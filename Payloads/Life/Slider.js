It’s a lean team, which means the responsibilities are that much more individually, and yet, we support each other to achieve our goals and dreams. <br /> <br />  Whether it is sales and marketing, product, operations, human resources, data scientists, analysts, engineers – we strive to learn, take risks, come up with new ideas in HR technology – and take everyone along to the next level. And all of this is done with loads of camaraderie, laughter, parties (and yes, some occasional hysteria and flying tempers) to keep each of us thriving.",
