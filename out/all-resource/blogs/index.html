So, therefore, I think that, in a sense, it itself is startling. This is, you know, for most of us would be a once in a lifetime event. And it has reset many things. It has reset personal priorities, has reset organizational priorities, and made big and small startups rethink their entire people strategies. In terms of specifically the talent shift in organisations today, I think two things are standing out. One is that varied work options are becoming table stakes. So, time agnostic work, remote working, distributed teams, job sharing, of these were kind of slightly, you know, alien concepts to about two or three years back. Barring a few people who had teams across the globe. This was not a norm, right. So, all of us had, let's say, a fair share of business calls. But these were like weekly calls and such like, now, the fact that most of us are doing eight to 10 hours on Zoom, or teams of Google meets itself is different. But more than that, I think it's also the fact that the pandemic has blurred the lines between work and play that for a lot of us. It is, yes, we might get to our workstations at nine in the morning. But very often, we're compared to what we end up doing, calls or emails late into the day. So, it's time for agnostic work; remote working has become a way of life - distributed teams, working remotely. Today, you will have people working from across cities within the same city, they are in different locations, and a lot of jobs get farmed out in what is called job sharing. So, in terms of talent shift, I think two things are standing out. I think one is organizations are looking at employees who can handle this uncertainty, right, the fact that it's not business as usual. Second, I think everyone, and this is both an individual and organizational, you know, the question is they're looking for people who are resilient, right, people who are able to handle all this uncertainty and still kind of cope, you know, without feeling unduly pressured. Third, I think there's also seek for a basic amount of tech-savviness right today, what is expected not just in terms of handling calls, but in terms of, you know, structuring your entire work online. In terms of organizations, I see two big things in the time shift. I think one is accepting the reality of a variable workforce; you don't need to have all employees physically at one location, you know, at one geography. I think that's become real. The second is shorter engagements - I think, you know, early elements of the gig economy are now beginning to be real. So, companies are looking at short term work contracts, hiring people for specific roles for a specific time period. And therefore, outsourcing has now become more mass; earlier outsourcing was slightly more specialised, it was kind of more technology-related. Today, it's normal to outsource things strictly a part of the core business because you recognise that the job can be done in a variable context. And part of it is also the pressures that organizations see uncertainty, so they want to pull back on costs. So, therefore, outsourcing has become real. So, suppose I were to look at the critical elements of the talent shift. In that case, I think one is, you know, looking for employees who can be resilient and who can handle uncertainty, looking at Tech-savvy folk, looking at a variable workforce, shorter engagements, and outsourcing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, as you said that today, organizations are outsourcing for all kinds of roles. Right earlier, it was technology, more technology. Now, it's gone beyond technology. Now. It's pretty much all kinds of roles. And the gig workforce is it. You know, where do you see the future? Because, yes, it's outsourcing. It's a part of outsourcing. So, where do you see the future of the gig workforce in this context?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAns: Yeah, before we get down precisely to the gig workforce, I just want to set the context of how we see it. I think one is, you know, millennials or Gen Y's sometimes call them their company comprise 35 34% of India's population, right now already about nearing 50% of the workforce. By 2025 this is expected to reach 75%. More than the statistics, I think it's the mindset of these millennials that is important. That is key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOne is – increasingly, millennials are beginning to become key decision-makers and organizations. In fact, the bulk of startups is being founded by people in their 20s and 30s who are pretty much-called millennials. Now, the way they're looking at this whole work situation is radically different from, let's say, a generation that was, you know, in positions of power, say about a decade and a half back to the early 2000s. So, millennials, I believe, have enough research to prove it are concerned about work-life balance. There was a survey done by Deloitte a couple of years ago, it said that almost 70% of millennials evaluate career opportunities, by good work-life balance, even more than organizations that they can progress in. So that has become a primary driver. And therefore, they're seeking flexibility in their work options. So, consequently, I would say the gig economy is happening on two ends. One is organizations that are seeing or feeling the pressure of uncertainty, who are trying to pull back on costs and work on what is called an asset-light model. So, they want to work with a variable workforce, and two is that there are a lot of younger people in the workforce who do not wish to stand committed. So, there was a client in my work career in the early 90s; we all looked for long, secure, ten years. You look for organizations that will help you grow and where you could spend 5-10 years or maybe more. Today, the average, we'll be looking at the kind of the growth what he's looking at jobs where, you know, if he's not satisfied in a year or two, he moves. So, I think this gig economy is becoming real on both sides of the fence, both aided by employers who are looking at shorter work contracts, more variable workforce, and by younger employees who are looking at, you know, fulfilling their passions, at the same time kind of making enough to get them going. Right. So, they're not really looking necessarily at logging 14-15 hours at work; they’re looking at, kind of, living a life independently by the side. And therefore, the gig economy is becoming real. And I think that is a positive strength, though, what I would say is that the economy has to be looked at in slightly more longer-term aspects. One is how companies can change the structures to accommodate gig workers in a more rational manner. And then secondly, and more critically, what are the underlying security issues that could take care of the workers? The obvious advantages of formal employment, you know, kind of provident fund and medical benefits and kind of long-term accumulations, ESOP's and such like? To what extent would gig workers also be able to accrue these benefits? And I think those are things that policymakers need to look at deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, as we see that the way people are working is changing, both from at the organizational level and an individual level. So now, how, in a similar concept, how is hiring changing in this way, because, as you said, we were all looking for long term security. So, hiring’s used to be different, more face-to-face, plus, you know, benefits of provident fund and all that. Now, with the gig workforce, the way they are being hired by an organization, it comes to security the way they are hiring more offline conversations. So, if I ask you what you've seen? How is hiring changing in this concept? And what should? What is the role HR is playing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI think hiring has been kind of, you know, significantly impacted. So key terms are that when organizational priorities have changed, and the pandemic has hit everyone very hard, I think hiring is a function that has had to kind of rework itself. The same old practices now may fall short to some extent. So, at a fundamental level, I think what hires are doing is working closely with the corporate teams to really look at what percentage of workers do they need to have on full-time roles and what percentage of work can be kind of contracted outside. So that’s one aspect. The second is I think they're also looking at strong traits, when hiring traits of nimbleness have the versatility of people who are capable of moving around roles, right. So, the rigidity of the fact that you're hiring somebody, a specialist vs somebody who can, in a sense, move across roles, maybe not functions, but certainly across roles. Because nimbleness is one critical aspect. Also, hiring is looking at, which are the roles that can be seamlessly outsourced without having to have a full-time resource. So, I think hiring has per-force had to embrace the gig economy. And like I said, for organizations, this new employee model works because it helps low fixed costs, reduces overhead expenditures, and limits their exposure to long-term medical expenses and lead costs. It enhances flexibility by having term and project-based contracts business needs and helps them acquire specialised talent for specific requirements. Very often, organizations found that they didn't have talent, and they had to end up training people. Now it's so easy to kind of go and secure that talent from outside of the short-term contract; you don't need to get someone on a full-time basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Q4: A small thing that I want to know is that when we've been talking of the pandemic, and the hiring in this context, most discussions revolve around IT organizations. Right. So, you know, you've been into sales, marketing, public relations, etc. These verticals have also changed, seen a very drastic shift in how their day-to-day operations were and how they are today. Why? Because they have always been very client-facing. So, how has it impacted their work and the business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAns:\u0026nbsp;Oh, I would see a couple of points. Around Yeah, I think fundamentally; all functions have been impacted. However, you know, and I'm speaking with specific reference to a couple of organizations that I work closely with one of whose boards I sit on, I think, organizations have kind of had to face the difficult question that why large sections of the workforce could work remotely - all the staff functions, like HR or finance or legal or various functions to categories have still pretty much at least the moment the lockdown is lifted, had to be back on the ground, right, one way or the Salesforce, especially those who are customer-facing, we're meeting, you know, distributors or retailers. And the other word in a sense, factory workers, right, a lot of factories can work remotely. So, I think one is the realization that sales and marketing cannot always be done remotely, right? I guess media buying and such functions can but when you think of operations, marketing when you think of, in-store, retailer relations, I think those are something that have been impacted. So, I think that's where the real challenge lies, I think in functions like sales, marketing, PR, I think those which are customer-facing which require physical contact, I think they've kind of been relatively more impacted. But like I said, the traits that HR is looking for organizations looking for people who are resilient, who can handle this uncertainty, people who can multitask, because you're talking about people who can, for example, I know an organization that was in event management. Now all of us know that in the last few years, event management has kind of virtually come to a halt. Now, they've had to actually repurpose some of their teams to start looking at different aspects. So, a lot of them today are helping organize virtual events, and therefore have to become technologically savvy. They have to kind of rework a lot of their skill sets. They've also had some of the front-facing account executive staff learning production. So, they're kind of gearing up for a kind of post-pandemic future. I think those who are willing to put up their hand and say, “Hey, I'm willing to multiscale, I'm willing to try something”, it's kind of helping. Whereas those who are being rigid and saying, “okay, this is what I was hired to do, this is what I'm going to do”, are going to face problems. So, I think the ability, or you can say that versatility and nimbleness are now becoming a critical aspect of how HR starts looking at hires all across, but more specifically within the kind of tools and marketing domains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, you've answered a part of my next question, which is like, the new skills that you see are in demand for the future. You’ve told me about non-tech skills like being resilient, multitasking, being nimble. Are there any other skills that you think that the new workforce should develop to be in business? Because whatever we've learned, we've, we've had to relearn. Right, so any other skills, you think that is important for the next-gen workforce to gather?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely, I think the biggest single skill that opticians are looking for, and I can say this, both for big and small organizations that I've worked closely with, is the willingness to learn. So, I think now more than ever, the ability to upskill, or rescale, is critical and positive. And fortunately, today, there are a lot of opportunities for employees to actually upskill and rescale. Right, there are online courses, there are various ways that you can actually make not just career switches, but become multi-skilled, right. So, I would say the willingness to learn, the willingness to upskill, to rescale. To try one hand as one's hand at new things has become critical, just one data point. And it's not strictly in the context of work, the last year and a half, have seen virtually a doubling in the number of retail investors in the stock market. Right. So, we're talking about the fact that a lot of people today are realizing that it's fairly easy to open an online trading account, right, you don't have to go through a broker and kind of do a small volume of either day trades a small amount of stock trading. Now, at one level, this is a risky investment strategy. But the fact is, people have realized that you're going to spend eight to 10 hours a day in front of a computer on calls in that free time. Can I also be doing a little trading with a little bit of training? A lot of this is self-taught. These are people who've kind of gone online, taking courses or even just gone to a YouTube video, and kind of have learned the way they started with a small corpus of let's say, a couple of 1000 rupees and overtime today are you know, are taking risks. So, I think learning is now becoming primary. Earlier in an organization, you expected the organization to work at learning and development for you as an individual. I think now the onus is on the individual, to what extent can he upskill? To what extent can he rescale? To what extent can he make himself more employable in a kind of future that is going to be more gig related? Long term job contracts are going to possibly reduce is my feeling and therefore the ability to move seamlessly to new roles, maybe new sectors and emerging sectors. Who would imagine, say five years from now? You know, roles in the metaverse in artificial in augmented reality and virtual reality will become mainstream. So, people who are willing to actually move ahead of the curve maybe will find themselves in far better employment situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. So, my last question is, we've seen a lot and a lot of talk around D and I, especially in the last one and a half, two years. So, you know, I was speaking to Shruthi Bopaiah, who is the Head - Client Engagement at Bridgeweave? And we got great insights on what is needed to be done in D\u0026amp;I, what organizations need to do at an organizational level. And at an individual level. The fact is that these things need to come from us within. But how are you seeing it shape up in India? I mean, is it really being taken seriously by the leadership in large companies? Or is it just a tick box? What are your views on it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eI think, diversity, equity and inclusion are now becoming a reality of business. And I think most mature businesses are beginning to see it well beyond a tick box. I think companies are taking Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. For one, it's no longer nice to do. I think people are recognizing that this adds value to the core of your business proposition, a business that works closely on DEI and who looks at environmental, social, and corporate governance, there is empirical evidence to prove is more successful. So, it's no longer a nice to do. Also, I think, importantly, in increasing polarizing times, like the ones we live in, it makes sense for companies to broad base their workforce. So, in a sense, it's a hedge against this polarization, and the best way you can hedge against polarization is by having people across the spectrum. Whether it's gender, whether it's a kind of multi-faith or multi-kind of cultural organizations, or even people who respect the fact that people can have different sexual orientations. So, I think DEI is now absolutely critical. To my mind, most organizations are taking them very seriously, for one reason is that increasingly, a lot of investors are beginning to look at the organization in this equity lens, right. So, they're looking at organizations through an ESG window, they're looking at organizations to how good they are on D\u0026amp;I. And I think that's becoming critical. The second, I believe, it's also good for business. If a business reflects the society in which it works in, it can only work better. I will say an organization that has, let's say, gender parity, and the same people from both genders as senior levels is positive. I think an organization that learns to respect people's different orientations or works with people across multi faiths or multi-cultures, I think it works very well. And therefore, when I see DNI, I'm looking at more than just the basic gender diversity. I'm also looking at thought diversity. When I ran marketing for very large companies, I think the best results came when you had a team that was multicultural people who came from different parts of the country or different regions, because they each bought a different sensibility, a different thought, a different dimension to an entire, you know, campaign or whatever. So, I think DEI is more than just a tick-in-the-box. I think it's mainstream. And it must over time get stronger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI want to take some time and comment about two other issues Anannya, in the context of what we're talking about. One is a little about the future of the workspace. And the other is, of course, the current little concerns people have on the variant and what does it do? I think what is totally why things were seemingly getting to kind of, you know, getting back to the normal curve in a small manner, I think this Omicron variant has kind of put a little bit of a hold on plans. So, I would see that the uncertainty is certainly going to be part of us for the next few months. A lot of us believe that you know, early 2022 will resume or get back to as near normalcy as possible. I think there's a little bit of trepidation, a little bit of a kind of concern about how this thing works. But hopefully, things will settle in my mind around the middle of the second half of 2022. And in the context of our discussion, if I were to kind of look at the workplace future, I think two to two trends are emerging in my mind. I think organizations are going to be adopting a more flexible work arrangement for their employees and also for their own benefit. So, I think the ability of an organization to start looking at Flexi or Flexitime offers both workings of having smaller offices downsizing and possibly highlighting people who are from remote locations. So, I think that's one trend, that's certainly going to be real. And the second, I think, is a more widespread adoption of the gig economy. I think people are recognizing that you're going to have gig workers as an essential part of your workforce, right, the old organizational structures where you had almost 80 90% of people on roles barring for very peripheral kinds of tasks, which you outsourced, I think, you know, that is going to reduce increasingly over time, what you're going to have possibly is a much more healthier mix of part-time contract, or gig workers was the core team that's going to be strung together, which is part of the core organization. And I think we're moving definitely in that direction. And therefore, like I said, earlier in this discussion, the onus for especially younger employees, to multi-skill to learn new skills, to get familiar with, with, let's say, technologies of the future, right, would be helpful. Like for Apple, I know for a fact that a lot of organizations, value people who've taken courses in Python, saying, “Hey, if AI is of the future, then someone who works in that will work”. I think those were some of the thoughts that I wanted to add on to this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, one quick question, while you were telling me the future of the workforce, I was reading this report, I don't remember the name of the organization. But, you know, I was reading that, with this growth of the gig workforce. This, this workforce will also move towards multiple jobs, you know, in a day, in the sense, I, they will be working not for organization x, but x, y, z. You know, so what are your thoughts? Because while we've probably never thought of that, never thought we will do two jobs together or three jobs together with the same kind of organization, the same kind of skills, but now this is opening up. There are organizations that are allowing, and there are individuals who are willing to do this? What is your thought in terms of this future? The data, the security, whatever, all of that, that which is involved here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think, therefore, it's probably normal for gig workers, not just to look at flexibility in terms of work times, but also flexibility in terms of roles, or from seamlessly moving to do work with two or three organizations parallelly in the same day, right, I could be doing a project with one company, the morning and towards the afternoon, something else, right, normal. I think the pandemic is also underlying, and I can speak from, let's say, my last few years in the IT space, has also underlined the importance of network security and some of these issues, right, we take for granted a lot of the elements in the physical office, right, where you have firewalls, where you have a certain degree of confidentiality protection, because of the way or, you know, you're kind of network is configured. But now you're talking about the bulk of the workforce being removed, right, and working from anywhere in the country. And a lot of environments are not in secure networks. People are working on public networks in co-working spaces and such like. So, I think the emphasis on network and security and protecting an organizations’ assets, I think now is emphasized. So, organizations that have strong business continuity plans in place, actually, they've put clear mandates about how they can handle this. And that also involves, therefore, providing employees with the necessary infrastructure, not everyone has access to a high-speed broadband connection, or not everyone has access to a kind of home office, which is, you know, totally kind of confidential away from your spouse or from you know, other interferences. So, I think that has become an important aspect. And I think organizations and individuals have to start thinking about that. So, all of us need to carve out our little workspaces at home. And it's not always very easy, you know, crowded, small apartments, let's say, cities like Mumbai, where you have a family of four or five living in small places, with the kids going to school or attending online school, the husband and wife both having jobs that require calls. Do you have the broadband infrastructure? Do you have that many sets of computers, tablets, etc.? So, I think it's kind of putting the emphasis, but clearly, the future organization will start to have to look at these things very deeply.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThank you so much, sir, for your time.

So, we'll jump onto the questions now. So, Shruthi, there's been a lot of discussion on diversity and inclusivity over the past few years. However, many are still confused about what they are and how they work. So, you know, for us, for the benefit of others, could you please elucidate what it means and what all does it include?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e See, I look at it in a very simple way. So when you think about all of that, that's I think, and being inclusive around all those types of people, you know, who they are, how they are, you included. How you can work around that I think that's really about the whole inclusion piece and what happened so, but there are many aspects of diversity, and I think that's important for people to, you know, understand. We've always known about gender and racial diversity, but today, there's generational, there's geographical. There's cognitive diversity. So, there's a whole bunch of it. But to answer your question on one more aspect, I think today it's not only about diversity and inclusion, but equity as well. I believe that is what we all need to understand - where we work, you know, it could even be at home, and you know, we're all in the social space as well, so I think it's that part about equity as well. So that's how I would look at it under now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, you know, this has been there. It’s not something new. People from varied races cultures come together to work together. That has always been there. So, why suddenly talk about it or the need for it as an organizational objective. Because you see, the conversation has really, really grown over the past couple of years. So, what led to this shift?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's a very interesting question. We all have observed around us that this shift is happening…not just at an organizational level but in our social arena as well. There is more focus on women, on race etc. Once again, I'm going to go back to the equity bit of it. I can talk about the shift on the organization side, of course. See, there are many talks, and I think that's what we have to understand — is it all just talk, or some real difference is being made? But to answer your first question, there is a rise in talent, search of talent or the talent war. And in all these different things people are talking about, the technology impact that's coming about is enormous. Where everybody has access to so much more information, education being available, and opportunities being available, at least we can think about it more equitably. And yet there is a pay gap, fewer women on the board etc. And if they are on the board, are they really making decisions? So, several things come into play here. And then look at the social aspect of so many people from smaller towns, and I'm going to stick to India, but if you look at it globally as well, people coming into the cities, so mindsets are changing. There's a shift happening, and that is what we see over a period of time. You know, when you say, why all this talk in organizations; the talk has been there, the talk has happened, and diversity and inclusion days have happened, I think, today, what we really need to talk about is, has that shift occurred, has that needle moved? Or is it just companies being pressured to deliver on diversity goals? Or are there companies that are genuinely trying to make that change? So, I mean, we'll talk more about it, and I'm sure you will have more questions around it, but I think that's what we need to ask ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eHow do multi-generational workforce and technology form a part of it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e It is the part of the answer that I was giving you. You know, this whole demographic shift that's happening, where people are moving to get jobs. When I say multiple, you say, multi-generational, I think it's also about in one workplace today, you have people from GenX to GenY, to today's millennials, and of course, the Gen Z are young, but it's not far away when they will also be a part of the workforce. But what does it mean from a diversity and inclusion perspective? I was reading this article, where it was talking about, there are hardly any directors on the board who are less than 50 years of age. So, on the one hand, we see that an experienced person sometimes prevents the young in the organization from reinventing the wheel; at the same time, organizations are also faced with this decision-making of creating 'Products \u0026amp; Solutions' almost an everyday basis. So, here is what we need to think about - they're already there in the organization. What organizations need to think about is how they will make multi-generational workforces combine and work seamlessly. I've been very fascinated about this whole thing around cognitive diversity. And I think that's really where we should all be heading to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eBut we're, of course, still solving some of the basics around diversity and inclusion, and we're still stuck at gender, race etc. Additionally, now you have the whole LGBTQ workforce coming in, so how are your systems geared up? How are your processes geared up? How is your performance management geared up to handle this? How's your hiring geared up? Do they all have access to equal opportunities? And let me tell you in the multi-generational workforce, and I love your question, because tomorrow, we're going to have robots working with us. How are you going to interact with them? You have to feel, treat them equally. You have to be inclusive around them. You have to accept even their flaws, help them get better, make peace with the fact that they can do certain things much better than us. So, it is also about all these things in a multi-generational workforce. So, I think creating a psychologically safe space for all these different types of a generational, multi-generational workforce will be the key to thinking about diversity in the long term for organizations. It's already here, and they need to be prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;This brings us to a fascinating question where I would like your thoughts. The other day we were, I read an article by Rishad Premji in the India Express, where he talked about Human Development Growth (HDP). And one of the measures mentioned there was the need to increase the participation of women. Because reports say that, even though there is so much hullabaloo around this topic - around inclusivity, diverse diversity, you know, getting women into the workforce. Still, in the last few years, we've seen considerably decreased participation from the workforce. There are very, very few women in the decision-making posts right now. As I said, there's a lot of work, but what is happening at the ground level is something that I'm thinking about. What are your thoughts on this? Even for our LGBT community, people are not ready to accept the fact. We may say we are pretty modern and think out of the box, but we don't do it at a certain level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, no, you're right. Rishad, this right, obviously, also, because it's here for all of us to see, right. The sad thing is what you said, 'the report says that it's getting lesser when it should have been getting better, ' right? We started so many years before; that's exactly how you started this conversation. We have started so many years before. And if you see, there is so much more awareness about this whole thing. Do you agree that there's awareness? Diversity is important. You need to focus on it; all that has also happened. But it has just become about that day. About March 8. The LGBTQ Day. So, this is where I think, organizations, and I would say, this is now not about HR, this is not about the diversity officer who needs to be worried, what should I be doing? How do I increase this?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is a CEOs mandate. It should be. The CEO should be rallying around this. Let me give you an example. So, if there is an issue with the sales numbers, how does a CEO approach it? The CEO won't be saying, let me create a celebrate sales month? And then because we're celebrating it, sales will improve? Of course not. That's not the way it happens. They get down to where the issue is. What are the ways to fix it? They look, think about it as a business problem. They think about it as tools and what can be done to enable salespeople and change mindsets and talk to customers. And, you know, what are the metrics saying what the evidence around the metrics is, so they approach it entirely like a business problem. And I think that is precisely how this has to be looked at. Only then and, coming straight down from the CEO, because that's when the other business leaders who are primarily male will look at doing this entire thing - making the needle move in a very different way. So, the approach to this cannot be about how we have done it, which is about celebrating it and making a day out of it and then forgetting it. It has to be about hiring an equal number of people; are we giving an equal number of opportunities? What does a performance management system expect out of managers? That's how it needs to be looked at.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, your question on what's happening at the grassroots level - grassroots level is the same. In fact, grassroots level, if you look at any IT company, 50% of the workforce are equal when they come from the colleges, then after you see this really sharp drop, as people you know, get to the top. Now there are several reasons for that. But what a company is doing to enable that if people have to take off for different reasons. And in this particular case, if it needs to be a woman, how do the policies and processes work to ensure that they can come back faster. And once they come back, how easy it is to bring them back into the mainstream seamlessly. There are a lot of things that need to be done. But the first and foremost thing is it has to become a business item and a business agenda. Just like if your sales were high, you know, your sales numbers were low. I mean, that's almost like the most extreme example I'm taking, but it needs to be looked at like that if we want to see a shift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So again, I'll be coming back to the question that one, why is it important at the workplace? And how can organizations move from 'some' to a 'from all' concept steadily?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So Anannya, I think I've answered some of it in my answer about how can organizations move to it? I think the answer lies, and I genuinely believe it is about the topmost leader because you're watching the topmost leader become a business item, and then the agenda, that's how it needs to be looked at, and it will work. In organizations, especially bias on the ground happens in different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere are five types of ways that it happens. So, I think this is what organizations probably need to look at to ensure that it does not occur. It borders on unconscious bias. But I think it's happening as we speak. So other than this, one way of doing it…the answer is, of course, the CEO making it a business agenda. The other way is to understand what all these biases are. So, for example, typically, for some people in an organization, this could be anywhere, globally, because whether it's race, gender, LGBTQ age, disability, sometimes even social class, this happens to different types of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo one is –\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Prove it Again'\u003c/strong\u003e. Sadly, there are many people in an organization; they just have to prove it again. So you could do something, but you will have to do it again. And again. And again. Unlike we are used to a standard person who would do it, and you'll be like, wow, that's amazing, this person met the sales target. Now think about it, if there was somebody in the example that I gave you, because of our biases was on race or gender or age, you just be like, 'oh, maybe this was one time. Let's see if they can do it again.' You know, so this prove it again, bias is sort of inherent in organizations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe second is\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'That Tight Rope'\u003c/strong\u003e. What that means is — if men, again largely, show that they are authoritative, you're like, wow, what a leader, walking the tight rope. But the same thing if women were to do it? The first thing people would be like, Oh! This person is so bossy? So, that's the thing. You look at it differently. And again, it's the bias. So, these are things that organizations should train people on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe third one is interesting. It's called the '\u003cstrong\u003eTug of War'\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a tug of war between like if I'm one woman, and up for that one position and there is a seat on the table only for a woman to come into this particular say panel or board. I'm now going to be having this tug of war with other women. And the same thing with race or people of colour, they are doing it with this similar type.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe fourth one is what we all call the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Maternal Wall.'\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;This is to do with women who actually come back and mothers who feel they need to prove that they need to do more. So, it's also about them themselves, but also the organization. They should be thinking about making it much easier because women are constantly otherwise about having to prove themselves. Organizations have to do this better for their seamless transition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow the fifth one is just\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Racial Stereotypes'\u003c/strong\u003e. Now we could be in India, but you know, to some extent, we're saying we're from the North, South, East or the Western part of the country. It just comes now; we don't even mean it so, and we sometimes bring that kind of stereotyping as well into into into work. So, there's so much we all need to work on, not only as organizations but also as individuals. That's how I would look at it. It's a combination. If we are all looking at this globalized world, we all have to drop our armour somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely right. There are instances, you know, while we were talking about this, I could reflect on. I've seen it, or I've faced it. These biases have been there; of course, they were nonintentional, but they've happened. Oh! You are a mother who's coming back after a seven-year hiatus? My God, how are you going to do it? How will you manage?\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAnd then the other way around — if you do it and you're succeeding at it, then they're thinking that maybe they're you're neglecting to be a great mother. This is so relatable, and it's not just me alone. There are so many women across the board who go through a day-in-day-out, and as I said, it's not intentional. It is how we've been brought up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. And it's a socialist, by the way, this entire thing. What do we take to work is who we are and who are we? We are all that we are when we are not at work. How we grew up, how we are at home, so organizations they'll train you and everything but end of the day you are going back home. There is a whole social aspect to how you live today. So, it's tough; it's not easy. Each of us has to almost open up and allow us to look at things very differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is Part 1 of the series.

The AI-powered EDGE Pathfinder then shows her the present jobs available in the organization, matching those skills. Now, the employee can decide to apply for the ones that immediately match her skills or choose to do a few courses, training, etc., suggested by EDGE Pathfinder to reach the next level, since it shows her the skill gap between what she has, versus what the job requires. There are a couple of stops on the way. So, the employee can systematically work on those steps to reach her next job profile faster. In that process, the employee can also define specific preferences like domain, location, reporting manager etc. Now, the organization doesn't have to worry whether the employee is choosing something which the organization is not able to meet. It also shows some very interesting things like what the trending skills in the organization are. There may be times when an employee sees a skill, is interested in learning it, but is unsure how it could help her career path.

Arjun like we were talking that the assumption is that EDGE Pathfinder will increase efficiency; so, how do you think it will do so in situations like we faced during the last two years?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e Firstly, EDGE Pathfinder, as a product, as the name denotes, is to figure out an employee's path in a very transparent fashion. What we have seen as a problem statement is the transparency of talent, both for the demand side and the supply side, which is the organization and the employed seems to be an illusion in many forms. And why I say it is because you come in with a certain aspiration based on your understanding of a role and you figure out that you're doing other things depending on the context of time and what the organization requires you to do. And there's a gap that exists there.\u0026nbsp; So, what am I coming for? What is the organization expecting me to do starts building that opaqueness, the Pathfinders reason to deliver this value to an employee is about transparency.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eCan I very quickly very intelligently provide you as an employee a career pathway, through skilling, through understanding what your peers are doing, what other people have done on this specific path, and then also provide you jobs that are available based on your eligibility?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is a very employee-facing, you know, application and even a product the way we are designing it in the product managers thesis employs a consumer who is used to accessing Netflix or prime or Amazon and Flipkart, HealthifyMe or Cult or Lever, you see consumer applications that sort of used to like Lyft and Uber in the US. Everybody's used to an instant movement between point A to point B, the via media is technology. And technology has to provide the employee that instant movement as a consumer of learning and pathways. That's what Pathfinder stands for. The efficiency that has to be built technology has to provide the efficiency versus providing more clicks as a hindrance; it has to simplify the journey for an employee, make it very transparent. And I think that is something that I'm going to ring the bell on — talent transparency, very, very important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. We spoke about how it's going to help employees, what are the benefits per se for HR and L\u0026amp;D teams if we could elucidate on that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. A relevant question again, primarily because HR and L\u0026amp;D are beneficiaries of understanding that people because they represent their workforce, the employees in many ways, right, a stability standpoint, from an engagement and development standpoint. Right HR and L\u0026amp;D, respectively, continue to invest their efforts current state, which is very fragmented, because they might not talk to each other because of lack of data. Again, goes back into how information flows from one to the other. And that information, how relevant is one piece of information to the other. Part of what technology does is normalize this information and translate it; the right one is acquiring the information. The other is the understanding of the information. The other is the normalizing of the information. So say somebody is disengaged; the person technically can be disengaged because they're not satisfied with what they're doing. And suppose you can take that disengagement and dissatisfaction at one level and connected to learning at the other level, which is literally taking this normalizing it to a learning path. In that case, your engagement suddenly might improve because you're starting to provide line of sight based on, say, just for the same job, the person gets more upskilled. They certainly don't lose sight of being a part of the journey of the team or the contribution that's expected from them. More often than not, you find that the person's expectation, the organization's expectation, and that mismatch is the gap that nobody knows how to bridge, and we're also talking about people at this point who are used to instant gratification. They're also talking about Gen Z and the millennial. The gig economy as we call it, where we're used to, you know, working on digital devices, working through applications that service their needs, work on, you know, three clicks to buy something, three clicks to watch a movie, three clicks to eat something right? So you're automatically saying that you're in a different world that requires\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis type of instant gratification and consuming to be mimicked within the enterprise. So if you're not able to see those signals and connect the dots between what HR represents and what L\u0026amp;D represents, and make it interconnected through, say what Pathfinder represents, which is a talent marketplace, employees to be able to learn to recognize to understand what their peers are doing what people in different organizations or teams are doing. There is a huge gap or avoid that that needs to be filled. The moment is starting to bridge that with tech, you're starting to establish another standardized level of thinking a new baseline, if you will, for employees to start leveraging, which means is more productivity and performance that you can see as throughput, for the organization to meet its strategic goals. Because you can't take employees and say, I'm going to organize you by revenue and margin goals in a very direct fashion. Employees have to be productive have to perform to achieve revenue and margin goals, which are oriented to functional or team goals, that orientation has disconnect. So, the maximum that you can achieve through HR and l\u0026amp;d functioning is throughput with productivity and performance, which indirectly, you know, so translates from an employee to revenue and margin, but very directly, productivity and performance will translate to revenue and margin improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e We spoke about the gig economy, millennials \u0026amp; GenZ. So, they're a different kind of workforce altogether. And their demands are very specific, very, very different from the current workforce. So, with Pathfinder, where do we see organizations move to in terms of bridging this gap, as you just said? Also, with the change in the workforce, we also change seeing a change in workplaces. So how will Pathfinder put these 3 pieces of the puzzle together? Right now, it's disoriented...dismantled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e One, is the nature of the workforce, which we talked about is the new gig workforce, and then the work itself. \u0026nbsp;See LinkedIn saying that you can work from home forever, it just that they are the right size, the right correct based on what your location of choice is, and the salary equivalent to that, which means that there's going to be somebody who was staying in San Francisco probably got more money, and then the person moved to Austin or Plano in Texas, and then the standard of living changes, you can't get paid the same salary. So, the right, correct, but what does that mean? That means that work itself is evolving, some people are saying we'll do a hybrid model, some people are saying come back to work, some people are saying, work forever from home. So, you're seeing different things peeling off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt depends on the context of the outcomes that the organization wants to drive. And it's also a choice that they are willing to leverage today based on employees and the satisfaction that they can drive them. Because one of the things that I see even within the employee base that we have, as a company, people fail to recognize how these choices are made. And whether these choices are something that allow them to have a better life. Usually, companies are judged based on their cost optimization moments or profit, you know, driven actions, which is what a company exists for. Unfortunately, what gets lost, is the ability of the employee to connect the dots to the employer on what the employer is turning around and helping the employee with; latently but directly with. It could be health insurance. It could be better working conditions, and better working conditions can be, you know, internet bill at your home, right, the effectiveness of giving you a few perquisites that you did not get in the past that you can leverage from the home-work environment or home-office. How do you do that? So even organizations have to figure it out. It might seem on the outset, very easy for an employee to judge the employer at that level but it is important for the employer to also help the employee understand some of the nuances of making those calls. And what Pathfinder does inherently is it allows people to, one, start getting into a more uniform collective sense of being within the organization so they understand where they are against what they're doing, where they are against what they want to do. And for the organization to have that transparency in their talent - they are able to look at what people aspire to do and sort of get that connection point. Then you can start leveraging all the peripheral benefits. So, there are lots of things that come as you develop as an organization, once you understand your talent better. The crux of all of this being a product company or service company is your talent and the decisions that you make for your talent pool to sort of enhance themselves, the underlying theme is about establishing talent transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, Arjun, you know, is this question that I've been thinking about. How are organizations placed today? Right? In a sense, this awareness, you know, we need to do this? Or how willing are they to adapt to this? Visibility is there, you know, they're still thinking about it? Or they don't even know that, you know, there is something that could help them?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e No, absolutely. They know that organizations are very aware of technology products and artificial intelligence, which allows them to go to the next level because these are now steady-state requirements. So, buyers are very sophisticated in their asks, and they're very aware of what exists out there. So, I think the journey has begun certainly. There's a lot of validation for competing products. Pathfinder will work to differentiate itself against companies called Gloat, Fuel 50, who have very, very solid products that, you know, sort of come to mind when you talk about a talent marketplace. Pathfinder does compete with them. The difference today is Pathfinder is very integrated into the talent supply chain, as you would see it. And we have, you know, forecasting, planning, internal mobility and recruitment products that form an integrated environment. And you have a core graph that has close to 35 million profiles that it's learned from those 11-12 million job descriptions that it's learned from and has taxonomy and anthology that powers it. It's a knowledge graph with natural language processing algorithms that allow you to get more proficient across what I talked about, which is acquiring the data, understanding the data, and normalizing the data. These are things that I think provide a significant change in terms of this value proposition.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think that organizations certainly know what they want, certainly know how to buy, have different models, which are transaction-based, employee-based, monthly recurring revenue, annual recurring revenue models. Procurement teams are more aware that it can't be like it was before in terms of enterprise license sales or simply a custom solution developed as a services project; those things have shifted. People understand platforms better and what the meaning of a platform is, versus it being in theory. I think those facts are clear. We don't have those challenges. Geographical challenges are more about data and literally buying behaviour versus anything else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I wanted to ask that there has been a lot of talk about change management and leadership these days. If you could tell us a little about your view on how Pathfinder can help build next-gen leaders within an organization and evolve the organization, help in change management, etc.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's a brilliant question again. See, the thing is that the evolution of people within an organization if it's graphed, and if it's understood across skills, competencies, roles, behaviours, and I'm talking about these different corners, which honestly, today we have some of those corners, some of them we don't have. But the truth is that if you are able to cover those corners, then you're starting to not just graph the person's journey, you're also able to capture the person's inclination, performance, attributes that will signal leadership qualities that they can be superimposed against the organization's requirement for succession. Then succession planning will become a reality. Otherwise, it's really a paint job. People talk about performance, or people talk about succession planning. In reality, what are they doing, connecting people to roles based on heuristics or past signals, and they are only left with those signals. So, when you start doing it at scale, you lose sight of it. So, if you look at Performance Management, or leadership, training and development, it's very human intervention driven today. There are a few different, I mean, very few products that can claim that they are doing it at the level, which is scalable, and that itself is a huge gap for it to be scalable. You need both sides of the coin. You need people who are beneficiaries of this development to sign up to it. The translation of this development within technology platforms is a reality, and that is very disruptive right now. It's not in a state where you're plugging into building a better product, but you have to build a product that will deliver, which means that we are building a category that has not been created changing a normal course of life to reflect performance and leadership development and succession planning within parks right, not easy. Change management and leadership development are itself if you look at it, very human interface instructor lead, if you would call it sort of intervention driven, it's not yet coming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe could be doing it this way. But you're still having this conversation, right? What if the platform of the application was training me on nudges or signals and allowing me in a bite-sized intervention driven literally every two days, every week manner, running me through a build-up and allowing me to develop my leadership skills, and position me better, or throw me courses and monitor the courses that I conclude, assess me get managers rating based on that course, and assessment all thrown the platform is another way, and I'm just making this up. But if that can be automated, driven through technology, then you're starting to get headway into solving that problem. But till then, if you create optics of having something there, and then you say that you know, people will talk to you through video, you know, interface, and then we will monitor it and record it, and you will be given a schedule that will be emailed to you. And that then is very, very free on the automation side, which anyway, if you sign up to a consultant, resume leadership training, then schedule it on your calendar, and they'll have a session across teams and zoom and do it. So, what is the automated fashion of tracking, they'll also maintain an Excel sheet. So if you take that and put it into one application and say, This is what the platform is, and I'm maintaining everything here, and that data is then going to pull through into some heuristics that science will also learn from, and then start making recommendations, that's going to be like a year down the line after you finish your first intervention, and your second intervention for that same organization or multiple organizations and collate that data. So, it's still at a disruptor level. It's a great market, but it's very nascent. And it needs a lot of attention to detail to solve for not a subject matter expert involvement and lot of tech involvement to build with the subject matter expertise on how they solve it in a man right that problem customer pairing has to be understood really well for you to build product-specific functionalities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, how is EDGE Pathfinder moving on that path?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e We've cracked the best the best level of entry, which is - we are not saying that we are doing all these things - we are doing a specific set of things for a population, which is technology driven. So, when we look at Tech driven employees, or people-oriented technology, which is now going to be most of the world, because you need technology to either directly help you in your job or indirectly apply some level of intervention in your job, then you are talking about a large population.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhen we go to companies, we're not really going to say that we are going to help you build transparency for your leadership, build succession planning for you, but we're certainly going to do it at the level where you have this large population of people that enterprises are struggling to understand. So, we build transparency for you, standardize your skill taxonomy, make sure your career pathways are understood between what we bring as part of market intelligence, what you define as HR career pathways for people across specific bands of employees and specific roles and skill combinations. We take that; we superimpose it with our intelligence across multiple organizations that we work with. And we're also, you know, looking at this daily when we graph it and store it into our knowledge graph. Now not only am I seeing signals of what specific jobs, people can move to what kind of skills they have as current to their profile, what they should be having based on an aspiration that they have on eligibility to do another job and connecting it to learning paths that say an LXP, like Netcast or LMS. We sort of connect the dots there. And that really becomes the crux of a talent marketplace. Because now the employee is empowered or the employee has eligibility and chances to figure out what next and navigation they are going to do in a career move within a company. And they're also going to say, Okay, if I needed to figure out how to do better at a specific job, what can I upskill myself, what if I wanted to move, but I'm not eligible. But if I did all of this, I would become eligible, they can make those choices today, those choices are currently very interfaced with intervention from managers, teams, and interfaces that are very static, or systems of workflow, not systems of engagement or intelligence. We're building a system of engagement and intelligence for our workforce, that can be dropped into our company, and then your employees are on boarded to it. And then they start moving into becoming a lot more real about who they are, where they are, what they want to aspire to do. And that is this signal of engagement and tension and development that you want to bring to your workforce. Otherwise, you know, even if you had to do something new that say I want to launch new health insurance policy for my employees, I want to give them a wellness benefit across the board, I want to give them vouchers, because they have done really well this quarter. And if I do it through the Pathfinder application, they're starting to suddenly see that all the interactions that the company is having driving it through the Pathfinder application as a consumer, you're consuming. And you get more excited about saying, Okay, I'm going to do a few more courses, maybe the company will give me a few more opportunities. So, what our thesis is that learning and development, career progression is also one part of the integral journey of an employee, which also has multiple other facets, which include this journey. So work is one thing learning is one thing and development is one thing, right? What are the other aspects of the employee's journey that you can cater to through Pathfinder, which allows you to say that Pathfinder is an application really that cares about those aspects have to be taken care of, which is I like watching movies, I like shopping. I like traveling, I like eating specific types of food. Now that is becoming who you are, right, any variable to graph that into what the person is capable of, through performance based on what you're graphing them as individuals across the board, that becomes the penultimate test of how a product like Pathfinder can work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e We've spoken about how it helps HR, how it helps various other departments. But now if I could ask you, what are the business benefits? Because organizations are thinking about how it will help HR how employees will be benefit. But ultimately, achieving business targets are also very important. So in that perspective, how will organizations see themselves bowling with Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI'll give it to you in a services context. Employees are billable entities of the workforce. They actually contribute directly to margin and revenue gains. What happens is that employees can see eligibility and access to jobs, basis the fact that they upskill, reskill cross skill or the fact that a job is available based on the current state, which means that they get empowered to self-nominate themselves for a specific job, or a specific career pathway, or specific learning. So, when that happens, you're already capturing a lot of information - one is you're making a person continue to want to stay engage, which means that retention engagement is done, you're also making a person develop themselves, which also means you're continuing to retain and engage. Now, if you look at these two aspects, engagement and development, create retention and reduce attrition. Now, when you create retention, you're already invested in employees, and if they're engaging in more gainful employment organization is gaining through billing dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIf you're having people become proactive to a learning path, because you're showing them a learning path or a specific career pathway that they potentially could go through, then you're again, driving them towards productivity and performance, which leads to billing dollars. So again, a direct impact to revenue and margin, it can't be more direct than this, because you're giving the wheel of the vehicle at the wheel of the car to the employee and saying now, now for that to become a reality. One is you have to have an application that allows the person to navigate, you have to have rules of the business that are fungible and open for the employee to get empowered, you have to make the ethos of transparency, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are reality for the workforce. And then people in today's context are going to say, I want to continue to work here. 50% of your people who tried and tried because they don't see any career development pathways within your company. Right. So that's significant. If you can address that 50%, you're automatically starting to build, you know, revenue and margin gains with people that are already investing, the moment you go out to hire, your hiring costs are your cost per hire, and your cost of hire is significant. Right? So, I think the map is very binary and you can really put it down to dollar value outcome where you can monitor your engagement and development to billing transactions, specifically in the project-based scenarios. And you can also do the math towards attrition and reduction in attrition based on the amount of the workforce that you're adding on your net. And so, I think there's a level of clarity that you can build on what is your ROI to project this from a business benefit. I think we as a company drive back to businesses because the nice and fuzzy is nice to have not necessarily to buy the moment you attach it to something that can build an ROI people are then going to want to buy it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd this is a product that people need to buy, because at the end of it, you are addressing a problem that you couldn't have addressed otherwise, because of scale, you have many things that happened, which don't allow you to provide engagement at the scale and at the real time level that you require, which is the problem. And that's what technology along with your subject matter expertise on what should be provided when should be provided get packaged well, through a product that's oriented to employees. So, I think this is my take on it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think there's significant movement towards people are understanding the value for that this is not a new problem statement, I think with the way organizations have built themselves and continue to build momentum, this continues to be a problem of recognizing where your workforces the other layer that's added to it is that, you know, 80% of companies are becoming project based, our product companies have projects that there are innovation projects, versions that they build, it's very pod based, and you need to understand the configuration of upon the age, you know, company in the healthcare, you know, space or company in the retail space. They're all doing things that at a different level, it's also about how they are adopting technology to drive change within their business outcomes. And that starts relating to how do you refactor your businesses, when you think about it, today, you're talking about different modes of work, because they have the ability through technology to service that model was available yesterday, not as abundant as today, because the business continuity plans that were engaged, when COVID impacted have certainly survived and thrived to provide people with options as an organization's and employees with options on what to do as you build yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Now, I would like to add a point here that some that is something this came to my mind is another benefit that I can see is when my attrition is low, my people are happy, I'm giving them a career progression, I am giving them an opportunity to be the next generation leaders, it creates my brand value. So tomorrow when I am out looking for people, the quality of my hire will also be good viz-a-vie what I had earlier. So that quality will also get go up, which will in turn reduce my HR hiring cycle, if I could put it that way. You know, probably this is also a business benefit that organizations can gain\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e A very significant point you just said was that the because of your upliftment of your engagement, your development through, say, a product like Pathfinder, they're automatically re- defining the quality of talent within your company, improving it to a level which also sets the baseline for the quality of talent coming into the organization. And that bar. If it's increased only means better benefits to companies. \u0026nbsp;Right. So absolutely. Right. Good point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I’ve already taken so much for your time. So, our last question could be on what is next for Pathfinder? We have already, such an intelligent technology in Pathfinder. \u0026nbsp;We are learning new things, what organizations need, you know, where we can help them where we can pitch in, what can we develop? And right now, we are seeing that that cycle is moving very fast, it is very important for organizations like us to move fast to meet those demands. So, what next? Or do we see the future in the next say I'm not going to three to five years? Because that's a long time in the next year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e I think everything is captured within the year. Now, if you build a plan for a year, then you're starting to talk about reality to building it for the next, you know, two to three years. It's coming, no offence to big companies, but it's a big company, you know, mentality and reality, not for a company of our size where we have to look at every 90 days.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003ePathfinder has an evolution to become a real solid talent marketplace and then drive towards an opportunity marketplace. And that is opposite marketplaces, building an ecosystem of other products on a platform that allows this employee to really find a life within a set of opportunities that the marketplace will continue to cater to. It means a lot of work has to be done on integrations and the creation of the ecosystem. But I think it's a byproduct of leveraging, first, the talent marketplace across the workforce that we are targeting right now. Today, we have the good fortune of close to 180,000 employees on the Pathfinder application as we are getting into some of our existing customers and deploying it. We have a lot of new customers who are looking at deploying Pathfinder as the first phase because it's about standardization of supply taxonomy, and then you can start doing it. Internal mobility as a transaction, you can start looking at upskilling and rescaling as a reality or as an initiative that you can see and translate to build business benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd you can start delivering value into recruitment as well, because like you talked about the quality baseline improving, and you understand what you really want from an employee to the outside world. And that sort of translates into how you, you know, embrace new people into a culture that you're able to support and drive. So, I think that's what I see as the next one year of getting more Pathfinder deployments, more marketplaces becoming real for companies of different sizes across different geographies. We have real targeted movement towards helping companies adopt the platform, and helping employees drive change within their environment through just this one factor of transparency, talent transparency is very important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much again for your time.

We will also talk about the technology part behind it and the roadmap\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Jacob, if you could, in brief, tell, tell our viewers what are the problems, that are currently faced by the industry, and how EDGE Pathfinder can be a boon for them especially in times where we are seeing an evolving workforce, and workplaces?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. At any, any time or any period of time, I think, this problem is clearly going to be there — matching the right people to the right job. So, or, in other words, the right job for the right person, the right person for the right job, both from an employee perspective, as well as an organization perspective, because everything else depends on that ‑ the happiness of the person in at work, the productivity of the organization, everything depends on this. So, I think this job to people matching is clearly a good problem to have, and it's got to be there always. So, that's the industry. And currently more so as the overall skill landscape is constantly evolving, especially in technology. Technology is just advancing at a rapid pace — it’s said that every five years, the entire skill set rolls over for the same job description. People are also at a constant effort to keep up with the trends of the industry, what are the best skills they want to have, etc. Companies are also evolving, especially in India. Globally too, the software services sector is becoming extremely popular. Why? Because everything is becoming software. Even the car you drive is now software. Tesla is nothing but the software in motion. So, everything is literally becoming software, and technology skills are just evolving continuously across whatever industry you take. So, in that kind of landscape, EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very, very interesting product for any organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow, why does it become interesting? For multiple reasons. Every organization's effort is to retain its employees. Especially the good ones who are performing well. But then, regardless of COVID, and COVID, just makes it, even more, tougher, it's very difficult for anyone in the organization to understand what the employee wants. Why? Because the career aspirations will be different. The skill landscape is evolving. And what do you keep up with? I mean, however, smarter resource manager you are, you just can't keep up with skill sets that match what the employee or employer wants. That's where EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very interesting product, for the organization — for the benefit of the employee and the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay. With your knowledge and experience with the product, how well do you think it is poised to solve concerns of internal fulfilment? Because see, that's not grown. That's not a huge industry, per se, because every time a resource manager or a talented acquisitor gets a requirement, the first thing they look for, is outside. Very rarely do people look inside. So how do you think it's poised to change that landscape?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. And it's a very important cost that we should play to where people don't have to look for an external job, because the organization is not able to meet their career aspiration, which is hardly the case because I mean, the reality is, every large organization has anything the employee wants, probably for a lifetime. However, the organization is not able to tap into them, the employee is not able to tap into them. Internal mobility, one of our products, actually gives the organizational perspective. So, it gives the resource manager of the organization a complete view into what are the profiles of every employee, what are their skill levels, what is their matching to the jobs which are available. So that's one view, which we already provide through our mobility product. That’s organization top down to the employee. But that's not enough. What about the employee? Now, your profile may match a demand that I have in the organization, but then that's not necessarily what you want to work on. Just because you're an expert in a certain field, doesn't mean you are eager to work in that field. I mean, we generally say that after a couple of times doing the same job, you kind of become a technology trapeze artist - you keep jumping the same loops over and over again. And you as an employee wouldn't want that. And that's where EDGE Pathfinder comes into play, even for internal fulfilment, the benefit is mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, the employee looks at her skills, she has a career aspiration she defines that through our product, EDGE Pathfinder, and then looks for jobs, which are available in the organization, which takes her to that direction. Now, it may directly take her in that direction, because there is an immediately available position. Or she might see a position and say, if I do this training, because we show her what's the skill gap between what she has, versus what the job requires, she can just do training, do an assessment on the training, qualify herself and then apply, I mean, it's probably a matter of a few weeks, of just doing that. Or she might have an aspirational position, let's say, a back-end engineer wants to become a product architect. There are a couple of stops on the way. So, you can systematically work those steps. Now, through this, it is beautifully matched mutually, where the organization is still getting the internal fulfilment done but the employee is also happy. So, you are actually having a better chance of the employee being retained in the organization. Attrition also reduces, the employee is more productive in the job, billing happens, billing cycle reduces, everything gets taken care of. So, mobility from an organisational perspective, but then EDGE Pathfinder, more so from an employee perspective, gives this opportunity. And so, fulfilment naturally happens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow, there's another problem, which most of these organizations face. People leave because they think they don't have a future in this organization. And honestly, that's not the case, EDGE Pathfinder gives transparency into that pathway, tells him you are in the right organization, you just have to look. EDGE Pathfinder gives options to the employee, you want to work in a certain domain, you want to work in a certain location, you want to work with a certain set of people, you want to be part of a certain group, you can just choose that. And then what happens, the employee stays; there is no attrition. A lot of times attrition happens because the employee is not happy, and then she starts looking out. The moment one starts looking out, your mind is gone. So, the attrition problem is also handled to some extent, that is the people who are leaving your organization for a better career opportunity can be retained in the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026nbsp;This was something that I told Arjun also in our interview, that all this leads to another thing, which we could also link to recruit. But from the EDGE Pathfinder perspective, it is reducing organizational costs. Second, brand building because if there's less attrition, your brand is built. Third, if I'm giving a career graph to an employee and that employee is satisfied, and there will be more chances the employee will bring in other people; they will also increase your quality of hire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely right. In fact, I was telling someone the other day, organizations are like an orchestra. A very good choir where, over the years when some of the core people stay then the quality of incoming people naturally increase because over time, the overall quality of the system the orchestra, the organization is improving, where the highly skilled, highly capable people are retained. And then people from outside come, everyone wants the best workplace. Hiring just becomes much easier because the word spreads. Why is this person not leaving? Oh, because he's found a career there. It really contributes even to the brand building of the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e And there's another thing that if you think of it is that a lot of times people join large organizations thinking of them as a stop-gap option. They’re like — I'll come here, I'll get training and I'll move on. I'll ask for a position, if I don't get it, I move on to another organization. However, if old employees are there, the lead is there, then they will also come in thinking that no, I have to decide if I want to stay here or not.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. See, employees are well-meaning. All of us employees, and we are all well-meaning. \u0026nbsp;Every employee is well-meaning. He or she is bothered about the career. And why would you want to leave when you have a career path and when you have people who you can learn from, and you see that they're not only staying in the organization but growing ‘like I have no reason to leave. So, things actually get taken care of. And so, you look at mature organizations, you will see people retention is a strength, while at the number level, they might have some attrition. However, if you look at the core. They stay and the core is the strength of the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Jacob, this is one part where we are able to understand how EDGE Pathfinder is helping the employee, is beneficial to the employee. Now, there are two aspects of it, which I would want your opinion on. One is how is it beneficial to the L\u0026amp;D teams within the organization? \u0026nbsp;L\u0026amp;D, R\u0026amp;D, whatever you call them, and how is it beneficial to HR?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e So, let's take L\u0026amp;D first and it is a very crucial part of the organization. EDGE Pathfinder, for instance, enables you to up your skills, so I look at a job opportunity. I see what's the skill gap. EDGE Pathfinder suggests courses. How does EDGE Pathfinder suggest the course? It’s because when we roll out EDGE Pathfinder into an organization, we integrate with the learning management system, or the learning experience system that they have. And then, it's a direct connection. Many a time the challenge of an L\u0026amp;D leader is that he or she gets asked the question, ‘Hey, listen, you're spending so much money on training the people, but then where is the benefit?’ How is it really targeted? Now, EDGE Pathfinder actually gives the L\u0026amp;D leader an opportunity to justify his or her spend on an LXP because the learning management system is fully justified because it's now connected. The employee chooses, she takes the training, she moves on her career path, she brings extra billing, she moves further on the career path, she brings a tree of billing under her, it's directly correlated. So, from an L\u0026amp;D perspective, it's a beautiful add on to whatever systems they have invested in for learning management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eFrom an HR perspective, as I said, multiple ways. Employee satisfaction, because finally, regardless of whatever HR can imagine and do, an employee's primary happiness comes out of job satisfaction. You're happy at your work, you're learning, you're in a good team, you're a happy employee, employee satisfaction serves its core naturally. Secondly, directly it reflects on low attrition for people who you really want to retain. \u0026nbsp;And it's very naturally correlated, people who you want to retain are also people who think about their development. \u0026nbsp;And that attrition is completely reduced. And all these things improve the brand, improves your hiring capability, makes you a good place to work in any survey that you may want to run. What better do human resources, or the organization leader want? People are the strength of any organization and it's not just IT services or anything. Anywhere, people are the strength of the organization. And we enable these people to stay focused in the organization. So, it's highly beneficial to HR.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, while EDGE Pathfinder looks very deceptively, like an employee tool, which is absolutely the intention, the organization benefits much more. There's no magic to it. A happy employee makes a happy organization. The organizational benefits are just tangible, quantifiable. I mean, you just look at the faster fulfilment of a position, the billing side. You just look at reduced attrition, again, the cost saved. You just look at training at the right time, it is an investment, you are again, spending for getting better returns. So, you look at any math you want. EDGE Pathfinder makes absolutely great dollar value sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Now we spoke about the benefits of EDGE Pathfinder. Now, if you permit, we would like to touch base with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder, and the features it has. So, let's start with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. So, the underlying of any EDGE product is the EDGE Knowledge Graph. The EDGE Knowledge Graph, our NLP based parsing capabilities, and the search and match algorithm. These are the core fundamental building blocks of any EDGE product. Right. So that still is the underlying technology, and that's our strength. And, we are always on a continuous improvement path in terms of how to really make the learning algorithm learn much more, that's our intention. Why? Because the more the learning algorithm learns about the organization, about its employees, the better suggestions we are able to throw out. So technology, fundamentally, is that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAs for features, there are multiple features, one, I wish I kept talking about, for the employee to upload her resume, connect to her social profile, LinkedIn, GitHub, or whatever; import those data into EDGE Pathfinder, so that you have a wholesome profile entered into EDGE Pathfinder within the organization. Then you can do define a career path, you can do a skill gap analysis based on that. We are integrated into the training systems, the learning management system, so she can actually take the needed pieces of training on an ongoing basis and up her skills towards the career ladder that she wants. Now, regardless of even a career ladder, sometimes they just want to try a different job. So, EDGE Pathfinder opens up the whole feature called ‘Smart jobs’, which suggests the best-fitting jobs for the employer, looks at the highest-ranked job as in where the employer has the highest match to the job description. Makes it very easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd in that process, also you can define the employee can define certain preferences - I want to work in this domain, I want to work under certain manager, I want to work in a certain location, stuff like that. So that also gets enabled to the employee. Now, the organization doesn't have to worry at any time whether the employee is choosing something which the organization is not able to meet. That will never happen because we integrate with the policy systems of the organization. So, it's mutually harmonious stuff, where what the employer sees is what's best also, is what the organization is capable of giving. And these are the essential features of EDGE Pathfinder, which really makes it a kind of a lifetime tool for the employee in her journey.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eEDGE Pathfinder also shows some very interesting things like what are the trending skills in the organization. So, you're able to see ‘what works best' That’s also important. I mean, even though I might be good at one skill, I see that this is a trending skill. Well, I want to pick up that skill. Let me define a timeline. And I'll just pick up a few courses to some certifications. EDGE Pathfinder finally takes into account all the credentials - your resume, your career journey, your certifications. The ML algorithm takes all this into account. When we actually do a search and match it's not a rule-based one, is the machine learning algorithm-based matching, where all these aspects are taken. You may talk about a skill, and you may never know that there's a skill cluster to which it belongs, and you can jump a job within the organization by just doing an adjacency skill upgrade. So, all these things are possible through EDGE Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, these are I would say the core features which the employee would see. From an executive perspective, the executive can actually look at a dashboard and see what are the training skills in the organization? How many people are moving their jobs within the organization? What are the most attractive roles in the organization? What are their most attractive jobs in the organization? So, the executive dashboard actually gives the buyer a sense of his investments. And you can see that in action. \u0026nbsp;The whole dynamics of the organization is consolidated in the executive dashboards\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya\u003c/strong\u003e: With the executive board you mean, the manager or the HR head, or…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean, the HR head, the L\u0026amp;D leader, whoever. Basically, it's role-based access. So, whoever gets access to that, at the leadership level, is not necessarily a direct manager because it's not really for the direct manager. It's for the leader of the organization. So, whoever is at the leadership level can get that, because it's a macro-level view, an aggregate view.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, tell me if I'm right or wrong, that it may help an employee, let's say, who's put on a 30-to-60-day, memo that your performance is not up to the mark and you need to improve? I ‘am giving a hypothetical situation here. And then that same employee is looking at his career graph and he sees some skill or a couple of skills that he or she can develop during that time period and jump on to another position within the organization. Is that also possible?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e That's possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean he may not be good for the current department, but maybe a great asset for a separate department?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. So, you're talking about a well-meaning memo and then people go through those turfs of career. Sometimes, even the smartest ones go through a trough in the career where you're just stagnating. And before you realize it, your manager tells ‘Hey, listen, you're in the wrong spot.’ Absolutely. If the person is constantly keeping in touch with EDGE Pathfinder, or if he or she can just go to EDGE Pathfinder, you can understand ‘This is where it looks like. Well, I thought I had all these skills, but all those are detrending skills.’ EDGE Pathfinder gives that view - what are the trending skills? What are the trending skills adjacent to my expertise level? Let me acquire that now. If I acquire that, what are the jobs which are available?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo absolutely, I think it's a very fair tool, a very objective tool, which is absolutely fair to the employee. So, the employee is given a second chance, I, honestly, I didn't think of that kind of use case, but then come to think of it, there are a lot of people who struggle with that in their organizations. They get lost in the whole employee base, and suddenly, they just get this information that ‘well, your skills don't make a lot of sense.’\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAbsolutely. This is why EDGE Pathfinder, honestly, is a career guide for the employee. It’s a mentor. Some of us are lucky to probably pick up the phone and ask, ‘Hey, listen, there is one job available inside the company, should I take it? Is it good?’ Not everyone is lucky to have such a mentor. EDGE Pathfinder is probably better than those mentors because a mentor is also limited by their exposure, the path that they have taken, whereas EDGE Pathfinder, powered by the EDGE Graph™ gives the whole absolute true view. In fact, much better than any human mentor, who will be away, available at a phone call.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Because a human may have his or her bias by default.

Yeah, absolutely. You don't have to even use EDGE Pathfinder, just to shift jobs. I mean, even within that role, you can look at the skill class and keep adding on your adjacent skills. So, it's not just for internal job movement alone. It's really for your enhancement. So, which is why I said it's a, it's an ongoing guide, I mean, whoever uses EDGE Pathfinder on an ongoing basis becomes a winner anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;If I could put it that way that it is very, very crucial for an organization as well as an employee.

And look at it also from an organization's point of view - it really democratizes the landscape; otherwise, it all depends on who I know. Do I know the right resource manager to find the next job? It is the complete democratization of the opportunity. And that's something which any HR leader would be proud of. It an equal opportunity that plays in its true sense.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely,\u0026nbsp;you put forth a very, very interesting point today, equality, because that is what organizations today have as their goals. And rightfully so. Equality in hiring, diversity, and things like that, I believe it can also play a very crucial role in fulfilling those kinds of objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yes, this is such a natural sprinkling of equality and diversity. In all the other things, the organization has to keep a mandate. It's an equal opportunity because it's available for everyone. So, I think that brings another flavour to the organization. The organization finally benefits because the right people are again in the right job. And that's our theme. In EDGE that is our theme - getting the right people onto the right jobs, right jobs for the right people. So, employee view and organization view both are met.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e And Arjun’s (our CEO) crux of keeping people at the core of every decision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Quick last question.

The success of EDGE Pathfinder lies in understanding you as an employee as you are. And that is where AI really comes into the picture in terms of what are your preferences stated or unstated? I wouldn't say unstated but subtly stated. So EDGE Pathfinder’s roadmap at a vision level is always to know the employee better, know the career landscape better and do the match. I don't have to spell out how, there are very well-established ways of doing it. If EDGE Pathfinder can know who Anannya is in her professional life, what are her interests, what are the reading interests, What are her social interactions through LinkedIn, stuff like that, you make a better suggestion for Anannya’s career. So that's really at a roadmap level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAlso, at the tactical level, we are looking at multiple aspects like integrating with the organization in a much faster way. EDGE Pathfinder, when it enters an organization is just another tool and the HR person will be like, ‘Oh, one more tool’. But that the beauty would be that EDGE Pathfinder can integrate with the ecosystem, it should ideally connect to the performance management system, but vendors should connect to, the learning system, which is already there, stuff like that. So it becomes a coherency builder in the organization. So, integrations are definitely another focus in the roadmap. So broadly speaking, I think I would limit it to that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Is there any feature that you may want EDGE Pathfinder to integrate in the future, something feature that is way ahead of the industry, per se right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e As I said, if I can have a clear, I wouldn't say quantitative, because that's kind of limiting. But yeah, if I can have a clear representation of the persona of the employee, in a very holistic sense. I would use the parallel, remember the days of Klout score, where everyone would be after Klout score? So, Klout score kind of gave an indication of how socially connected you are, how influential you are, are you a thought leader, are you a follower and stuff like that. I think the path of success for EDGE Pathfinder is really that, in being able to successfully personify the employee.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think the strength is in what we have already the EDGE Graph™ which is already at a very mature stage.

So collectively, with the product and the knowledge graph and the ML core integration, I think we'll be able to come to that feature where we are clearly personifying.

Then again, employee engagement has different facets like learning and development, mental and physical health. Reports say that the priority for organizations today, and those organizations who are people-centric, is their employees' mental and physical health and well-being in this pandemic. However, they also need to look at the other factors that hamper an employee's growth, apart from their well-being, which is more professional and helps get a perfect career path.

And one of the most significant problem statements starts from the HR tools — HR systems used by the companies, like the ERP's and the CRM systems and how they have been utilized in the past. These HR systems have been static records, ideally developed internally or externally by ERP tools by keeping certain things in mind. They weren't designed by keeping in mind that they will be providing insights or solve the challenges which industry has faced today. This leads to multiple other issues, and employee engagement has come into the picture. But one of the things companies have to focus on today is how they can better enable these tools better? How can they put better HR systems into the picture, or how can they utilize the HR systems. For example, I'm just going to talk about one other thing quickly. Every company allows its services based companies, which we have seen is focused on two specific kinds of things, and where they spend a reasonable\u0026nbsp;amount of time and money on that piece. And then the effort. Basically,\u0026nbsp;the query architectures and the competency normalization and the competency structures we stay to have, right, because it becomes the source of information for the company to map their jobs and company to map their employees to those skills, competencies and the roles actually, right. And by the time they are done with like, like, obviously, the companies does have the internal experts, but they mainly work with third-party experts. And because of the static behaviour, what happens when experts are done with the changes? That environment has changed. So it becomes irrelevant when it goes to the real users and goes to the natural environment. It becomes no use for the organization, behaviour, culture and the people's business or employees visibility and becomes a challenge. I think that's where they need to start utilizing the tools and the products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;And they have been utilized technology basically to provide the dynamic environment and the behaviour, which can solve the need of the time. And also look at the long term and the small-term and medium-term goals and the companies to enhance them keyaki they're ready for the future as well. And they're prepared for the current environment as well. And it is prepared to sell to the people in the according to their need. Right. And so that's where companies have to focus on these kinds of products and tools are the technologies. Now, once this problem is solved, I think what does it look like to the second one of the most significant problem statements, which happens in the\\industry, is the internal job boards actually, right? Because in the end, before attrition occurs, people must lookout for better jobs inside the company because that's easier than anything. Some companies don't have internal job boards, which\u0026nbsp;doesn't provide that visibility and transparency, that can enable that growth, give some objective for people to look at the development inside the company. This is where today's internal job boards can't compete with the technology available outside because they don't have an excellent user experience. They don't personalize job recommendations based on people's skills or aspirations, which they have. And then that's where which leads to the there are specific behaviour and the policies the way they have designed, which will lead to the environment ofbeing not having the right kind of visibility's actually like like employees\u0026nbsp;doesn't have the visibility on the jobs based on the companies' policies because of certain circumstances. And it's, so these create an unpleasant experience for the employees. And they don't see any futuristic growth, which leads to finding alignment in other companies or other environments and the culture. So I think companies have to focus on internal job boards, or some tools and the technology which can provide a great user experience, personalized jobs, and transparency about the policies and what are how does the company look at them from the jobs perspective and how they can we target to the next call, as part of the carrier growth. What\u0026nbsp;are the possibilities inside the company that's where the technology can\u0026nbsp;help them. Most organizations today are outsourcing these capabilities. They have started exploring different tools with smart intelligence. Here, AI-based personalized job recommendations have gained critical momentum for people to keep engaged inside the company. With that, HR and company leaders are coming to understand the power of AI and enable better engagement by putting the right technology product and the platform inside the company that can provide this kind of great experience.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, Rahul, if I could ask you at what stage is this in organizations today? Is it relatively nascent? As you said, it is also a significant source of attrition that people don't have that kind of visibility. So, how major is this issue today? How are our organizations even realizing this?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo, I think many of you thought of it. They may have realized that they need to do something to stop attrition, but do they realize that there is a need for an effective mechanism to increase internal hiring's, visibility, speed of hiring but at the same time reduce costs. With such a mechanism, all these factors ought to be met. Some companies have job boards, which is very tightly connected with the HR based ERP systems or some different kinds of systems.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow, what happens is that companies are unable to hire people internally, and employees are not able to align to their jobs or are not applying to the internally available jobs because obviously, the transparency is not available, visibility is not there. So, these need to be worked on. Organizations have to change their orientation of 'employ first and search later'. Internal employees, referrals can close positions faster internally, but I think that happens rarely. And that happens with a specific set of people. Now, that's where HR systems like EDGE Pathfinder come into play. If you look at today's data, more than 30 to 50% of people don't put their information on HR systems.. their skill sets are known to a few, maybe their manager or colleagues. There are mental records but no physical records. That's not a scalable approach; it will not help companies come out of these kinds of crises. As I said, organizations need to change their approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThey need to move to 'employee first from business first' because it is\u0026nbsp;their employees who make and break them. Thus, it is essential to match their aspirations to those people and support their next career move. With the right kind of mechanisms and tools, people will stop relying on mental abilities and put stress on capturing the information in the right way. Gradually it'll build up the confidence of the employee, and they will start trusting these tools. That's the right way to scalably solve these problems and answer the organization's medium-term and long-term goals. It'll make them future-ready.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, this is more from an organizational perspective. How aware are employees of this one? Second, there are multiple reports published now and then that speak about cloud computing, SAAS, etc., as the skill sets trending today. How does it help me as an employee? Am I skilled enough to do that? Or what is the skill set that I need to grow to be relevant in the next two to three years? How is that working out from an employee perspective? What is the challenge on that front?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSure. So I think the topics in the previous point, like the HR systems, internal job boards, or others, are disconnected systems. The need is for one centralized platform, which obviously will answer your question as well. It will align organizational goals to employee goals, see employee aspirations and suggest skill sets relevant to grow. So, in a way, personalized job recommendations will help them move towards their aspiration, like the training skills they're targeting. But certain rescaling, upscaling can happen immediately; certain paths can be taken immediately.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think there must be a proper strategy and plan for the reskilling by the organization based on the employees need as well. First, let me speak about what organizations think about it because it's a critical need for the organization as well. And that need has come into the picture because they are not able to reduce the workforce, or they're not able to relocate the resources to the right project or attritions, and the alignment and the automation. Because of that, it has forced companies to become employees first, which leads to focusing on rescaling and upskilling as an opportunity.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;According to a McKinsey survey, 43% of organization's say they have a skill gap today. This means they don't have people with the relevant skill sets to take them to their next growth step. In the next two years, 22% said they would have the skill gap in the next two years. And the remaining 22% say they will have in the next two, three to five years. And some other percentages of people say they do have in more than six to 10 years. Now, this is a large percentage.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;Companies have to focus on the new skill sets, mitigate the need for reskilling and rescaling, and focus on providing the right skill set for people to learn. Now, again, it has to be done by two ways because if you look at companies, they used to have the internal L\u0026amp;D teams or competencies team which were helping people to align what kind of skill the path they need to take. That's where one problem existed because every organization has a limited set of the catalogue for people to reskill/upskill their careers based on their aspirations. And organizations were not giving preference to it. And due to the lack of information, like obviously, people also need to have the right kind of environment and knowledge about the competencies for rescaling who should be skilled, because it was becoming difficult for companies to design personalized reskilling path. Skills are becoming obsolete, the obsolete that companies face today; it has because of automation, which means many organizations don't have any choice to remain existing in the current environment or become better than their competition. So, they have to focus on the skill game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you think from the employee perspective, they know skill is coming to the market but do not know if they are capable of adapting to it or need the skill-set, but these are becoming their aspiration. Now, how can they target that aspiration? And how can they focus on that aspiration? That's where the ideal fulfilment has to happen through some platform. And, that platform has to be highly engaged with every tool with the organization, specially LXP's, because previously, the approach was taken top-to-bottom. Now the approach will also be bottom-to-top in the dynamic environment where employees have the freedom to choose what kind of skill-set they desire to have or learn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe other issue for you to look at as part of reskilling is that earlier, and every organization had specialized people. There are four kinds of competencies or models that exist.\u0026nbsp; \u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e, which means people are competent or have the competency in one kind of area;\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eT\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;where people are competent in one kind of area, but they do have the breadth across multiple competencies. The third model is\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003ePi\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;which means people have depth across two competencies, but they do have the breadth also, and\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003eCos\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;where people have the competency across multiple other things and the breadth across multiple skill sets. Now, people have realized because of the dynamic behaviour of automation, companies and employees want to move from AI to t, or I to pi, or T to pi or T to Cos. If you look at companies that are leading the world in the innovations, their people belong to the Cos kind of competencies. Those who lead to the kind of growth they're creating, the innovation they're making for companies to sustain in the future and lead countries and the world in a new way defining the new dimensions. Now, every employee wants to move from one level to another, and that costs, right? And that's where companies are trying to define that. They want to provide transparency; they want to give visibility and work on something new to sustain in the new environment. So if this kind of crisis happens, employees are ready to take the lead. And this rescaling will enable the new leaders; it will help them in the succession planning, it will help them in the reduction of the cost as well. Now think about it. I'm just going to give an example. Today, the specific specialized people you hired to work on high-value projects need multiple specializations. Then again, you need more with another specialization. To hire specialists, the organization has to make that extra spend, the extra investment. Now, what if the same two people can be upskilled as a part of their aspirational plan? It's a win-win for both. The organization saves costs, and the employee moves to the next level. This is precisely what the platform should allow you to do. This is exactly what EDGE Pathfinder will enable you to achieve. It understands what is happening in the market, can decipher the current or future needs of the organization, details the needs and aspirations of the employees and links them in unison. But this experience will not be enough without having the right kind of LXP because you can create the right kind of recommendation for the skills. You can learn. You can tell people okay, learn artificial intelligence, machine learning, analytics, blockchain, augmented reality or virtual reality, but what if they are not suitable methods to focus on or the company doesn't have the appropriate learning materials in place? In that case, they're still not getting what they need, and the employee may quit for better pastures.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, if you have the right kind of LXP plus this kind of platform, then what happens? It leads to your employee satisfaction, and it leads to most of the positions are getting fulfilled internally. This will help companies to achieve the two things as well. And that's where an employer will become the enabler. And the from past, which was a business was the enabler. I think the employee will be the enabler; they will start taking control, acquire revenue through new channels, and be poised to be ahead of the competition by utilizing futuristic technology. People will automatically start thinking about taking more control and act very quickly in dynamic environments to increase the growth and benefit the environment. At this juncture, we can safely say that the two create more value for each other.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So if I could say this in a brief, today, the skill gap is quite blurring. Organizations don't know which skills will be helpful to mark a change, achieve targets, and make profits. And they will also be able to guide their employees in that space. But as of now, it's pretty nascent. Both are still learning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yes, I'd like to add on top what you said. See, it's happening because if you're taking the people-driven process, it's not easy to build a contextualized learning for each employee. Think about the organization size of more than 100,000, 50,000, becomes very difficult if you take a people-oriented approach. And that's where the platform has to come into the picture, which can solve this problem at the scale because the platform will have the AI and AI will have the information or should have the information, intelligence from the market which leads to the future. And look at the ambition which people do have and consider all the factors. Today, people are thinking from the organizational perspective, some companies are thinking from the employees perspective, some companies are thinking from the board, organization and employees perspective, but I believe this environment will help each company because of their limitations, which will help them to get all these at the larger scales, very contextualized learning who can raise to what kind of skill set who can focus on what type of skill sets.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you put two kinds of people on the same skill set, they coming out from different backgrounds the learning will be difficult, very different actually. You can't also put a timeline to how much time they'll take to get upskilled or re-skilled. Both are very different personalities with different capabilities. So, it's essential that organizations take a leap. And think of not what is going to happen in five years, down the line. But basically, think of short term goals. How can I bridge the gap and reach achieve my yearly growth? Because it's so unprecedented that we never know where the industry will take us in the next few months, where the situation will be. Yeah, and what kind of technology will be introduced? So it helps companies to be ready for in the short term, medium-term and the long term and futuristic as well? We are hearing the news of companies becoming digital-ready because certain companies act because of their people. Why were they able to do that? Because people were upskilled, re-skilled, and the company utilized the technology to enable people to be ready in that concern, that kind of environment. And people creating more value through high value created projects. So, we addressed all four issues one by one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now, if I could ask you what is your take on the future workforce? Workplaces, we know, are changing. And that is the reason organizations are getting employees ready, digital-ready, things like that. But what about the workforce? So basically, yes, the workforce is not yet prepared; they are not. Still there, they are aiming to be there. But with the changing workforce, the current workforce is dominated by seniors and millennials. And the next workforce is Gen Z, which is similar to the millennial but very different. And reports say that by 2025 1/3 of the working force will be Gen Z, and we're pretty advanced in these aspects.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo, what are your thoughts on the challenges for organizations to deal with that kind of workforce? They are getting prepared for the challenge today to\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003ehit the pandemic; you're on its and move forward,\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003ehire and acquire skills and competencies to beat that.\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eBut this is with a specific kind of a workforce with the changing workforce in the following two to three years or maybe five years, where do we see the industry moving towards?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSee, I think looking at the past few points, which we have spoken about looking at companies focusing on HR tools, are the products which can solve the problem of data and static records\u003cstrong\u003e,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003ea platform which is solving internal job boards, platforms that are solving the rescaling upskilling, plus a platform that solves the career path thing and the career progression as a problem statement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce organizations have this kind of platform on to that company, it will help them be ready for that, define the future, and be ahead of the competition. That is going to happen because of the workforce and the workforce which will they create. Now, let's take, for example, the Gen Z workforce, which you said is going to come on board. I think the AI-based platform will allow the organization and workforce to be ready in that environment because it will create an environment of ownership, pro-activeness collaboration, and mentorship. It will put them in the environment because the company will keep allocating them to new projects, either helping them learn the skill sets or acquiring behavioural skills and competencies. It will enable the kind of culture which will serve the need of the Gen Z workforce. And it will also help companies boom because they will have the next set of leaders who will start creating the value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd I think it will change the culture that companies used to have because of specific policies. People were not moving across the projects due to skill-sets but due to policies. Now, the dynamic environment, quick movement across the projects, and all the dynamic dimensions that the company and the employees will be taking will help them be more collaborative and proactive. In the end, the value will be returning to them as part of that; they can focus on the new kind of skill sets to create something out of their personal goal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Right. So I think, you know, we've spoken about all the things, all the situations and scenarios, and the challenges that organizations and employees face today. Yes, the future for companies developing these AI tools is also great because they are also learning with constant internal and external changes across the pool. Right. But, you know, one last thing your take on, where do you see the AI organizations building these tools go from what they are today? What do they need to achieve in the next few years? Where do you see that? This is about organizations who are developing those AI tools; what are their challenges? And what is it that they need to move ahead?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRahul:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSure. So I think lots of companies are focusing on these particular areas. Because they understand the importance of these problems and how important is it to mitigate these problems. So for organizations, that AI-based organization, or let me call it AI-based, talent decision platform, the obvious challenge is data. But I think the challenge will be how they can enable the future. I'm just going to talk very specifically about machine learning which is always about learning from the data. The teaching will come out from what they have based on their domain expertise, which is providing the data plus the kind of information they have internally plus what kind of information they will be getting from their customers or users. The quality of that information actually, that is the one challenge. The second challenge, even when you forget that learning because that learning is coming from the past. The challenge is how they will enable that futuristic vision because that learning is about past behaviour. It is all about how your AI systems react according to the environment - understanding the data, the signals, and the information is critical to enable the new capabilities. So today, right now, we are talking about internal job boards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd we are talking about skill rescaling upskilling opportunities; we are talking about the career path, scarier progressions, we are talking about better normalization of the information, right. But there may be a problem that does not exist but may come up in the future. How is that going to be managed? So, AI-based companies must design their product platform by deep thinking, crunching the data, digging the data to enable the new capabilities and solve the problem more efficiently and effectively in the very dynamic nature of culture. And in your environment, that's what they need to focus on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think they have to focus more on building a great product, but that better, that great AI-based product, will come by focusing on building the right kind of data-based platform. And by acquiring the right type of talent, resources, people and technology, they also have to enable a more efficient way of utilizing the technology. So they can create much more value than that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eOkay, great. Thank you, Rahul.

While organizations are making an effort to provide in-office capabilities, it will only be restricted to 2-3 times a week.

It is a potential goldmine that, when used optimally, will save significant time and effort. According to an industry report, 67% of large companies and 56% of medium-sized organizations have difficulty filling positions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis repository of different resumes collected over time has been created either through career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves going and getting some resumes.

You would find a resume lying in there, which was acquired some time ago but never used. Either the applicant didn't meet the job criteria, was a second choice to the position, or were not available. It means that the candidate was not hired for the particular position, and their resume is just lying in the repository without any meaningful use.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is where EDGE Recruit comes in and plays a significant role in the hiring circle. Recruit isn't merely a system of workflow but a system of intelligence. The product is integrated with multiple applications and platforms that make the task of hiring simplified and effortless. The brain behind EDGE Recruit is our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, when you have a task in hand, all you're trying to, as a recruiter, do is try to find the best possible candidates who can fulfil this position. EDGE Recruit helps you do just that. From collaborative hiring to storing a candidate's holistic profile, our AI-enabled product possesses the capability to parse through a gamut of profiles within few seconds. It then provides you with instant and accurate matches for a job description based on criteria like skillsets, diversity or location, while tackling unintentional and unconscious bias. Recruiters can also search for candidates based on time and cost sensitivities enabling improved conversion rates.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eA candidate who may not have been hired earlier may have better opportunities within the organization in different roles. It enables HR to pick the resume from archives and see if they match some other job? And it might turn out that there might be a better opportunity awaiting them, apart from what they applied for. EDGE Recruit provides for this matching, where one part of the flow is you have a job in hand, and you're just trying to find the matching candidates for that job.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe other way around is also possible; you have a resume in hand, and it looks good. It might not be a good fit for the opening you have presently, because as a recruiter, your visibility is restricted to few jobs that match your own. But if the resume is part of the talent pool, there's an ability to figure out if this person fits other jobs in the organization. It helps recruiters meeting their own KPIs and fulfilling positions for the employer.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eEDGE Recruit also helps recruiters create and manage this candidate base effectively by auto sourcing.

And I'm going to focus on that facet, and why hiring continues to be a problem which is a lot to do with the way we hire, which fundamentally, if you look at the statistics, also, when you talk about the future of work and the state of talent acquisition, its various reports are being generated primarily because of the world-changing its way of delivering value or creating value through steady-state businesses, or verticals, as we know it, they're reforming, refactoring to deliver this value to their consumers and to their customers. And hence, the need for people within the business to help them restructure is of paramount importance. This is why I think there are two facets of it, the loss of your job or the job loss side of is one piece of the writing on the wall that we've already read. The other is reinvesting in hiring people, which has become the next mantra because you're trying to figure out now, based on growth, that you visualize how you could get the right people in to deliver the outcomes that you want. So hiring will continue going through the roof. I mean, an economy like the US, which is, I think, investing $6 trillion, and its restructuring and rewiring will see a boom. And that's a signal to the rest of the world because they are the number one in terms of GDP, followed by China, and they are looking at how they can bounce back and deliver this value post-COVID, which are seeing real signs through various facets of the ecosystem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, I think the answer is that talent acquisition will continue seeing a change because people will figure out how to solve the same problem in different ways. After all, other facets of that one problem will start becoming efficient; some facets will continue to evolve or stay inefficient. And then therein lies the ability to create that opportunity and start tapping into it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eTechnology is only going to provide you with a means to an end. And when I say it in a very simplified way, it's automation, data science, analysis, input, information retrieval, etc. These various things will come in and play a part in helping people identify the right talent. So I think that's where talent acquisition is and where I think there's a huge, massive opportunity over the next decade.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;As we discussed before this, Mercer's recent report states that organizations across the spectrum take a very long time to hire. Only 20% hire within a month; the rest take a cycle of almost three months to fulfil a position. Now, if you could elucidate how EDGE Recruit can solve this concern? And how are organizations poised to benefit from it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, my theory of life is not based on my concept or my perception; it's about being in this domain, understanding hiring the way it understands it from people who are a lot more accomplished in hiring as you mentioned, Dinesh from our company was, you know, in JPMorgan Chase. He understands hiring competencies, talent acquisition, retention very well. And like that, I've met a fair few people within our business, our customer base, to help understand what we bring to the table that changes the game. It's not about searching and matching in AI as we know it; this is the science that comes to mind. It's also about helping people through a process. And that process has to get streamlined. The process has to get efficient. The process has to get very nimble. So, simplification of this process is of paramount importance. And what happens is when users like you and I are also recruiters or working with recruiters based on our needs? We also have to understand that as a user, as a recruiter, I'm used to an Ola, Swiggy, Uber or Netflix, which is very nimble and simplified in its ability to navigate. And that's the same, that's using a B2B application.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, our effort in EDGE Recruit, as with most EDGE products, is to simplify these talent decisions that recruiters are trying to make on behalf of a hiring manager or a candidate who wants to join a company, tap into an opportunity. Making that efficient making that simplification possible through user experience, across different filters that we gave across different stages of the process, is really where it counts. AI will also compound the benefit by learning across the steps of these events and starting to calibrate, re-adjust itself so that the product begins to deliver better results through the heuristics that it picks up in some of the signals that it already has within the system. So, EDGE Recruit is a great product because it's focused on simplification. It's about the user, and the user is the recruiter, in my view, who's going to continue to deliver this value of bringing somebody on board – it is very critical to performing within your organization. That process has to be simple. It's also about delivering that automated, clear, simple set of steps to help the recruiter suddenly move from I'm shortlisting the candidate, I'm screen candidate, I'm going to help schedule an interview, I'm going to help, schedule an assessment, then, you know, start the verification processes or multiple things, and then you're doing it for 50 people. You sort of lose your marbles at the point.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIf this process can be simplified and automated in many ways, the information is available to the recruiter. What happens is that the recruiter starts diving back and giving the candidate a better experience in terms of the onboarding, the journey about understanding the position to lead the outcomes. And that conversation is got a lot more value. So, I think as recruiters focusing on making sure that the dialogue between the recruiter and the candidate is very streamlined and very valuable. So, we have done the other pieces that we could automate and make easy for the recruiter to access.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eArjun, there's a lot of AI being used in the hiring industry today or if we could say that organizations and recruiters are moving towards it steadily. People are going digital; organizations are increasing their technology adoption. If I could ask you, what changes will we see shortly with the combination of various technologies and AI being into play? How will it benefit the organization, the recruiter, the employee - everybody in that circle?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, the changes are going to be simplification. It is also about the different niche or point solutions working together. So, the sense of partnership and collaboration is going to be a reality. And partnership and collaboration will then start giving you what we call platform benefits. So, the platform will then start housing different pieces of the puzzle or various parts of the process - from meeting a candidate through their resume or their profile and starting to engage with them as they go through the process. That I think is going to start becoming platformized. What is going to develop future or forward-looking from that is the ecosystem. In an ecosystem, you will have multiple players within the niches that will start defining their set value props, which companies then can pick off depending on what they need for what part of the process and what they deem is fit for them.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt's like the Ambassador and the Fiat? Both are cars. Which one do you like because of the shape, the size etc., is your choice? Likewise, you will want a specific assessment partner, a specific interviewing software, a specific background verification partner, and a specific set of companies you want to hire from a particular interview set to interview in a panel. How would you modulate all of that? If that is simplified, and if that becomes platformized, then what you're doing is navigating the person through that, rendering the recruiter drive more value into being like a concierge service for the candidate to move across into\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eonboarding. And I remember the Ex-CHRO of HCL, Prithvi Shergill, citing that this should be like a concierge service. I think it does make a lot of sense. His vision was to somebody, literally from being identified to being onboarded, have it happened within five hours. Can you actually run that assessment interview process, screening, background verification, and offers rolled out within five hours? It seems euphoric and sort of ideal state, but it also appears believable and doable.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd I think at some point, people have to believe in simplification and compression. I know some of the customers we deal with. Incidentally, HCL is a customer of ours. They have really visionary people sitting there and moving things to define these processes faster and better. We have people in Wipro who are constantly looking at streamlining and making it the most efficient recruitment process. Just giving a few names, but we have close to 500,000 IT services, employees transacted across a platform, and millions going through the recruitment process. So, it's a benefit that we drive. Platformization is one key area of significance. Some people expect our companies to be platformed, as a virtue of them having a SaaS product, but platformization is also about allowing multiple products within a company to be housed in multiple products outside of the company; it also is housed in, and that's really about true platformization. And then the ecosystem where you're starting to look at how you can better be the general community through the ecosystem. And I think those are the stages that we will see talent acquisition move through.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd in benefiting the candidate, the case, since everything will move, the position will be filled up filled faster. Candidates will be chosen based on merit, without any bias, in the process because some of the focus areas have always been, how do you build in diversity and inclusion? How do you build in sort of an equitable process? How do you be meritocratic? And for that, do you have to take some of the conditioning or the unconscious bias that we have out of our systems and technology today plays a huge part in making it a level playing. And for that, you have to build your AI, right. You have to build your product right. And I think all technology companies are focusing on delivering that value through the product thesis of solving that problem in a genuine sense. And I think companies are benefiting from that. This is why many companies have a change in the ratios that they have a difference in the kind of productivity and impact that these ratios give them, which is an important facet. You are building a company to be productive and delivering value. But the other side of it is, you're also missing out on the fact that the candidate comes in with a lot of promise and how you guide them through the process and how you guide them through the journey of being with you is so important. It's about getting that fitment organized and reorganizing or reshuffling that fitment based on the aspirations of the person and the organization's aspirations, personal success to the organization's success, critical to correct, and my belief that I can see in the products that cater to it. It's not something that's in the making; it's here to deliver value. And I think we're at the forefront of providing value through our product, making kudos to our team who has worked really hard on, you know, setting that targets for globally competitive products and creating this value for the candidate for the recruiter for the company. So we are meeting those sorts of very linear sets of intervention points where it's necessary to solve these problems; otherwise, they are very disconnected. They continue to provide a lot of inefficiency in the system.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Right. So, what's more, in the sense that, what is the roadmap ahead, for EDGE, for EDGE Recruit and the industry?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, so for the industry, it's about obviously fueling the many companies and the many people who need to meet with companies that are a constant focus. There will be a consumer-focused set of applications; demand focused set of business-to-business applications will continue to be built. It's going to see many that change primarily because the jobs are evolving in the nature of the construct. What kind of skills you require, what kind of competencies you need, what kind of depth you require is still in the air, and it's being fleshed out to start becoming table stakes and understood. That's where companies like us continue to play a part in the definition. Once the definition is real, then the identification happens. And then, the planning is also a part of the process. So we believe that the definition of identification and planning is very vital to the circle of employability and gainful employment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt's essential to be in that mix, where you're looking at all the signals across these different industries that require people in various capacities because of the way they see themselves today delivering similar outcomes or the same outcomes. It's just morphed because automation is rife, efficiency has come in, technology has provided changes to the sense of direction, in one sense, or the sense of speed, to achieve production that's already been oriented. So I think for us as a company, we believe that we will go out there and really be the career guide to every individual on the planet. And for that, we are building products that will start first on the simplification level, where talent decisions are being made, where we can help companies across that process, help candidates across our process and support employees across the process. So we have a few products that we've built on a talent decision platform that focuses on the employee, focus on the resource managers, recruiters, workforce planning and forecasting pieces. And it's all focused on the people pillar. And I think that's the area that we believe that as a forward-looking movement, the opportunity to build internal talent, places and opportunity marketplaces and deep platforms exists. And we're going to tap into that because we think there's the value that we can create based on our line of sight in the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Great.

For the uninitiated, she is our go-to person for EDGE Recruit. So, without wasting any more time, we'll get on to understanding the various aspects of the product. Also, we would be really interested to know how the team \u0026amp; business leaders harped upon the idea of EDGE Recruit?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Sure, so I'll take you back to how he started his journey. We started by matching internal employees to the job openings within an organization. And that is a journey, we continued for a little while. And it was eventually search-and-match that we were doing; we had the jobs in hand, we knew what the job is asking for, we had employees on the other hand, and we could match those employees to the candidates. We soon realized that this concept of search and match does not remain constricted to just internal employees; the same could be applied to the external market. And that's when we tried to filter it off to external markets by matching the same job instead of employees, the external candidates. And that is the idea that eventually developed for EDGE Recruit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhile we were good at search-and-match, this is the journey that continued for us for a little while. A couple of years back, we tried to rehash what we were doing so far until now. So, while we were really good at what we were doing until now, i.e. search-and-match, we realized that this is just one small part of the entire problem. There are a lot of other issues that are still lying unsolved in the whole recruitment function or the recruitment cycle. If you look at it, recruiters, on average, get about 400 applications, which can go to 10,000 or so. For a human to sit and go through all those resumes is an impossible task. And that's why you keep hearing those keywords 'make your resume catchy'. Frankly, people glance at it; you have three seconds to catch their attention. You are not the only applicant. There are 1000 more people like you. If I put myself in the recruiter's shoe, that is the best they can do. Either they can go about going through those 1000 resumes in a linear fashion one-by-one, or they would randomly pick up the resumes or something. If something is interesting, it is prioritized. Now, in that entire day of work, you would tend to lose some excellent candidate that was matching your requirement and was not at a high cost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere is no way for you to figure out in one glance who is the best among those 1000. How do I even prioritize? And that's what we provide. We provide a stack ranked list of candidates by matching those 1000s of candidates to one job in just seconds. The recruiter has to review each profile no longer to understand what all skills they have, is good or bad, to match the job at hand. All that task is done and presented to them readily, to see who out of those 1000 are the best match to the job. But this, too, is solving just one part of the problem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhen you look at the entire recruitment cycle, you have to source the candidates from multiple job boards and screen them. After that, you need to check everybody's availability to get the interview scheduled. There are numerous systems involved where a recruiter will have to go and update their status, keeping so many people in the loop, including the candidates. This entire process in itself has a lot of problems. And that's where almost two years back, we started our user discovery session to give a fresh look at what we were doing so far and how we can improve. We spoke to CHROs of Fortune 10 companies, hundreds of recruiters in IT/ITes services, our existing clients, and the other ones. And those user interviews are what helped us in realizing the gamut of problems that lie in this space and how this entire function had transformed over the past few years when we started our product journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, those user interviews are something that helped us in identifying the problem statements. I had my own hypothesis, my own theories laid out. I wanted to ensure that my understanding of the problem statement or my idea is what I wanted to validate with the actual users, which are the recruiters. This is the cycle that went on for quite a reasonable amount of time and for a very long time, dwelling in the problem space to figure out all the problems that lie in this entire recruitment cycle and the problems we're solving for. In the first version, we cannot solve everything, but I have tried to solve the product key problems that I figured out from all of these interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And so, you know, as you said, this is version 1 of the product that we're launching now. So, what were those features that you thought of when incepting EDGE Recruit? And how has it changed today? What new features have been added, and what features can we expect in days to come?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;One of the key value propositions of EDGE Recruit is the ability to source from multiple job board's. So each of these organizations has their repository of different resumes that they have collected over the course of the period, either to career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves going and getting some resumes. So there is a repository that they have, but you can think of it as more or less just a database, which was never maintained. You would find my resume lying in there, which was years and years old. So it's no more applicable. If you look at that resume, it will no more apply to the job you must be looking for. So when you have a job in hand, all you're trying to, as a recruiter, do is try to find the candidates who can fulfil this position. Now there are multiple sources through which you can find out those candidates. You would first start with your own talent pool - your own repository of data, which has its challenges presently. It's not maintained, it's ancient, you wouldn't have updated information, even the candidates' contact information is unavailable maybe, and so on. The next step is to figure out where to find the candidates, and then you go about who to contact. Now, even in the market, there are multiple job boards. And for a recruiter to go about doing that, they will have to go log in individually to each of the job boards, figure out who all the matching candidates for the requirement and have all of that information consolidated somewhere in an excel or something right. So that is an overburden on the recruiter. So you don't have to go to multiple job boards trying to figure out the candidates. From our application itself, you can auto source candidates from job boards directly so that you will eventually never run out of CVs. You can keep on increasing and improving your talent pool through this auto sourcing. Of course, you will never run out of talent pool; you have the entire market available for you to explore through this auto sourcing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the other key features that I would want to discuss is how the recruiter's KPIs and the parameters they are judged upon. So one of the KPIs is employee referral because they are pushed towards fulfilling a maximum number of positions coming in through employee referral. Now, that cycle is also somewhere broken in a sense; when an employee would refer their friend or someone against a particular job. And that is just a one-time opportunity. It could be hit or miss for that person. If the referral matches the job, you're through. If not, your resume goes in vain. Nobody else will look at your resume after that to figure out that this person, although referred for this one job, has better opportunities that he/she may be able to fulfil in the organization. So, why can't I take the person's resume and see if this person matches some other job? And it might turn out that we have a better opportunity for this person than something that they applied for. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo we provide this reverse matching as well, where one part of the flow is you have a job in hand, and you're just trying to find the matching candidates for that job. The other way around is also possible; you have a resume in hand, and it looks good. It might not be a good fit for the job you have presently, because as a recruiter, your visibility is restricted to few jobs that match your own. But if I have this resume on the system, and there's an ability for me to figure out that this person fits ten other jobs, why can't I proceed with this resume for those other jobs. It helps recruiters meeting their own KPIs and fulfilling positions for the employer. And even actual data says that there is a higher possibility of closure, of any candidate eventually even joining you if it's coming through an employee referral. Otherwise, in this entire scheme of things, a candidate might end up not joining you after making you wait for 60 or 90 days of the notice period, which to an extent is solved if it's through an employer because the confidence is already in place for your organization when it's coming through an employer. And that's precisely why even organizations that try to push for employee referrals above other categories are going in the market and trying to find resumes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere are a few more exciting features that we have introduced, and I'll take a minute to talk about those particular ones. So one thing being ours is an AI system. And we genuinely believe that any candidate, if they are to be screened, should be filtered based on their skill sets' quality and experience. Nothing else matters. With this tool, we are trying to take care of the unintentional or unconscious bias that may creep in while looking at a particular candidate's profile. We are trying to take. It could be anything - gender, liking towards a specific organization etc. A candidate coming from a great organization might create an unconscious bias towards favouring a particular candidate. However, there might be another candidate equally or even better than this specific profile. So in this tool itself, we provide means for you to tackle the unconscious as that may come in screening and ensure that a candidate's screening process is limited or is happening only through their qualifications and experiences, nothing else. Diversity and inclusion programs are people promised visions who want to deliver upon right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;It is gaining ground these days everybody's talking about. It's a company on vision these days to maintain that.

So through EDGE Recruit, we all want to help recruiters and help the organization meet their diversity and inclusion goals.

We aim to help recruiters with resume screening and interest check emailers, candidate management or interview scheduling.

Till now, we were talking about EDGE Recruit as a product, its features and how it's going to help recruiters. Now, we'll speak of it in terms of business impacts. What are the business impacts it will bring for organizations?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan: \u003c/strong\u003eTo answer this, I will categorize three organizational goals we are trying to target - time, cost, and quality. The time it takes for you to hire or close a position, the cost you are hiring for a particular position, and the quality of hire you're bringing into your organization. Time and cost are understandable, and everyone talks about those, but I will specifically talk about the quality of hire. How are we intending towards improving the quality of hire? So, we're adding AI algorithms to assist the recruiter in assessing a candidate by providing just-in-time insights that they may have missed and are critical for the particular position in hand. So, we experimented a lot and figured out that performance capability can be assessed through social grouping. When I say social grouping we are currently looking at GitHub and StackOverflow. Your entire scope of evaluating a particular candidate so far has remained restricted to just their resume. It is their impression in a snapshot, nothing else beyond that. And if you look at it, there are many different areas where people showcase their capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eGitHub and Stack Overflow are the top two sites that I would go to for developers. GitHub came to India in 2018-19, I think. And by 2020, they had more than 1.8 million developers who joined GitHub. As for their estimations, by 2023, like nearly two years later, they expect there will be 10 million developers who would have joined GitHub. And India, for them, is one of the fastest-growing markets. There may be many projects and activities that the developers would do or have had a repository of at GitHub and Stack Overflow. So, within the product, we intend to provide a view of all that a person does, even beyond their resume. We fetch all that information, activities, etc., and give a recruiter a picture of what they're doing beyond the usual.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis, in turn, helps in validating what the resume is. Nothing stops a candidate to declare what they want in their resume. But when you can see proof of the same in the activities that a particular person has been doing, it helps you validate and be confident that this person poses what they claim to be. Suppose all of those are taken care of in the earlier stages - during a screening. In that case, your probability of taking many people over to the interview stages and then falling on the numbers drastically, would also decrease. The reason being you will be proceeding only with the candidates who you believe are really true to their word. And have the capability to clear the interviews, right. The funnel that exists right now is very heavy until the interview scheduling and then suddenly drops. With this in place, the funnel will be tight from the beginning stages itself until the hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Thank you Neha.

And it gives us some very interesting insights. It says 82% of employers plan on hiring in 2021. Of these, 37% plan to rehire to backfill jobs, and 35% plan to hire new positions.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo now, according to you, what are the morbid challenges that are faced by organizations today in hiring - getting the right kind of talent for the right job? What is the current scenario? And how do you think an effective talent management solution can solve this concern?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDinesh Menon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Right. Yeah, I mean, I think the core that is, and I think it's been a problem for a while now\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;finding\u0026nbsp;the right person\u0026nbsp;for\u0026nbsp;the right job. I think that remains to be done – the problems around how to source and how to hire have changed. So let's look at the last year. In respect of COVID\u0026nbsp;and all that's happened around us, attrition has increased across the industry, right?\u0026nbsp;Look at it,\u0026nbsp;the industry attrition has gone up, which means refills are going to happen.\u0026nbsp;Most\u0026nbsp;of the large ones have their order books complete\u0026nbsp;for the year and for years to come. What does that mean?\u0026nbsp;They're gonna hire a lot more. You know, we have here companies, couple of our customers speak about hiring in few 1000s,\u0026nbsp;of times peak mechanics\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;1000s in a year, which means hiring is going to stay.\u0026nbsp;The recruitment fraternity is really seeing a new wave of high attrition recruiters because the demand for recruiters has increased. And because of this, a lot of companies are having a brain drain, if I could use the word in terms of recruitment as a function.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eA company hires, recruiter invests time, trains him or her to be a good record and starts getting productive. And then you see the recruiter move out, you know, and we've seen that, in my experience, I've seen that across customers where I've seen a specific recruiter\u0026nbsp;leave because the customer's location has moved to another\u0026nbsp;zone so on so forth. Because then there is demand for recruiters, there is significant hiring happening. And there's loss from a brand standpoint we're looking at. So what really can help is obviously automation. Like being able to know, the learnings from recruitment that has happened in the past\u0026nbsp;-\u0026nbsp;the ability for a perfect system to come in and reduce time in terms of hiring, which will then obviously, reduce time in terms of facilities, costs will increase profitability, and so on, so forth. So I think a good recruitment system, automated recruitment software is the need of the hour. Yeah, I mean, it's been there for some time in the markets. It's not that it's a new concept. But how efficient are those is a big question.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Right? So\u0026nbsp;like you said,\u0026nbsp;there are a couple of solutions in the market. So\u0026nbsp;on that front,\u0026nbsp;how effective are they vis-a-vie\u0026nbsp;EDGE Recruit, our AI product?\u0026nbsp;And on that\u0026nbsp;front, what day to day problem\u0026nbsp;will it solve for recruiters?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDinesh Menon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So,\u0026nbsp;let's\u0026nbsp;look at it this way - let's break a recruiter’s life into maybe four or five\u0026nbsp;phases - demand generation, sourcing, video selection, assessment, and onboarding. Now,\u0026nbsp;where does a\u0026nbsp;recruiter spend most of his\u0026nbsp;time?\u0026nbsp;Sourcing and sharing. And because of this today, if you really look at it, many recruiters are not\u0026nbsp;doing a\u0026nbsp;recruiters job because they are just busy getting a CV, running it through\u0026nbsp;the\u0026nbsp;TA team and\u0026nbsp;pushing it across. They\u0026nbsp;aren’t\u0026nbsp;really doing the interview process, which they're hired for. What is the recruiter’s job, what is the value a recruiter brings? It is\u0026nbsp;to really interview\u0026nbsp;a person, understand the candidate’s profile, understand what he or she knows, what the job requires, see a match in terms of the fitment in terms of behaviour, or skill sets, in terms of culture fit, and so on, so forth.\u0026nbsp;However, today, most of them aren’t able to do that because they are running behind the\u0026nbsp;TA team, which is itself, you know,\u0026nbsp;is a\u0026nbsp;high-pressure\u0026nbsp;job. Now that's where the beauty of\u0026nbsp;Recruit really comes in, how\u0026nbsp;Recruit is being built.\u0026nbsp;It is\u0026nbsp;built on the concept of mimicking\u0026nbsp;a\u0026nbsp;recruiter’s brain.\u0026nbsp;Just think about the fact that you're mimicking a\u0026nbsp;recruiter’s brain into an application, you're marrying the same thing with artificial intelligence, and AI is something an over\u0026nbsp;abused word. Everyone has AI in everything these days. But it's important, though, what\u0026nbsp;Recruit\u0026nbsp;brings in.\u0026nbsp;So the AI in recruit is based on learnings from close to 35 million-plus profiles across the globe and 10 million job descriptions.\u0026nbsp;So it's learned to looking at all these data sets, understand what a job family is, role as a skill is, and then marry what a recruiter will look for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhat're the first few things a recruiter looks for in a resume? The profile obviously, but the compensation, the notice period, where the person is located etc., is important too! You know, the experience a person brings in this case, and the skills and the, you know, the different experiences from a product standpoint that the person brings in, and so on, so forth. Now, that's where EDGE Recruit is able to really bring a big difference - it really helps reduce your sourcing time significantly. Having used the product for our own organization, I think we’ll easily save about 50 to 60% of our time on sourcing. Then comes the other functionalities in terms of, you know, scheduling etc. Once the right person is identified with the help of EDGE Recruit, it's about going into the next stages of the hiring, like I said earlier, that you have assessments and so on, so forth, and you can move in, so that it really brings in value in terms of sourcing, helping you source the right person in a much, much effective way. And you know, that not only reduces turnaround time but your costs and enhances the quality of the CVs that come. This streamlines operations and ensures a recruiter’s exit doesn’t hamper the brand deeply. The recruiter leaves the learnings, or they're in the system with EDGE Recruit, the new recruiter comes and starts using the same system. Right? The system has learned. So, the knowledge management around the brand stands intact.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Great. So, yes, you know we've used EDGE Recruit ourselves. What are the benefits that we've seen, from an organization perspective, and what do you think the business impacts or the benefits EDGE Recruit will bring to the industry per se?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDinesh Menon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, the way I look at it is as I mean, it could be a repetition of what I just said earlier, is that you know, clearly recruit helps you source faster, it gets you the right kind of people that you want, right. And if I look at organizations, the large brands get around 15,000 to 20,000 CV’s which come in a month or so. That’s a huge untapped treasure just lying somewhere. If they can exploit all of it, use what they have, instead of spending money on either vendor or through portals, they can reduce cost significantly, right? So, you can reduce costs; you can start engaging with your employees, get employee referrals in place and use all of these effectively. Every business leader would want to end the day seeing like-minded people or the right quality people coming in? That's good engagement. Right? So you, you not only are reducing costs, and you know, increasing, reducing your turn around times, but also starting to engage them.

An ideal hiring process with the right mix of automated and augmentative AI should be something like this - automotive AI scans through thousands of resumes, and augmentative AI assesses each profile for its novel experiences and distinctive traits that make it unique; to provide talent professionals with the candidates who best fit the job profile. After that, automated AI takes over the regular tasks of scheduling a call/ meeting with the candidate, sending them updated meeting requests giving the recruiter scope to face-to-face interviews and assessing the candidates‘ skills compared to their resumes. An intelligent talent management solution also accords the recruiter to recomb the large pool of unhired candidates who may have gone through the interview process smoothly but were never hired. This pool provides top-notch candidates who may not have the requisite experience but can immensely contribute to organizational growth.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAugmentative AI can also help talent managers compare the skillsets of recruits to other successful hires in the past, creating a powerhouse of data and hidden gems that can be mined as and when required, instead of relying only on new resumes every time a new position opens up. This can be clearly understood in times of the pandemic – with the pressure to increase performance and downsize the workforce, organizations all across are facing a tough challenge. They could hire the best talent across industry lines and categories but ensure they could deliver. Thus, the barriers of location, geography, timelines have disappeared and what has remained is diversity and inclusion. Today, a person sitting across the globe could be recruited to fulfil a particular position handling complex jobs, which could otherwise only have been performed by aspirants from a specific sector or city.

I joined the organization when it was a fledgling company with a lot of ambition to establish a global footprint. I've been with them for 15 years now, managing the India region, which comprises India and Southeast Asia, \u0026amp; is the largest engineering presence for NVIDIA outside of the US, close to around 3000 direct employees \u0026amp; 1500 contractors.

We are typically a very, very serious tech kind of a company, very work-focused. And we believe that people derive joy from work. But in the last year, we've actually put together a set of programs that helps employee's kind of showcase their talents. And, incredibly, there are so many hidden gems and lost skills in the company that we were not even aware of. It's been a successful initiative since the human side of the enterprise has come to the forefront. It's impressive to see how leaders have become a lot more transparent and a lot more palpable as human beings, as against just people who were kind of setting direction and energizing people to accomplish business outcomes. But it's incredible to see the personal side of the leaders across the company as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;How have the employees in the region you govern coped with the pandemic from a personal, professional and workplace level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think it happened in two phases. I think, when it started off, there was an element of crisis that had kind of hit the organization and the employees. And people were trying to figure out how they make sure that they continue to deliver to the expectations. And I think there was a little bit of heroism that was kind of coming in, right, which is that people thought it's a crisis, they need to go above and beyond. And they were actually kind of getting to a stage where they were in a crash and burn mode. Right. And I think the way I look at it that roughly around a quarter, into it people realize that this is not kind of going to go away. And it is not the time for going above and beyond. But it's about making the adjustments needed to kind of acclimatize yourself to the new way of working. Some people were burning out in the initial stages. They weren't infrastructure constraints they were dealing with - they were kind of trying to grapple with managing the personal crisis, as well as their desire to kind of continue to find meaning in what they do from a professional perspective. But I think they have now gotten used to the new normal. Obviously, as a company, we have kind of created an enabling environment as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe told them not to worry about the deliverables work and take care of themselves or your family. That is a priority. And we kind of extended to the level where we said we don't want even our contingent workers and partners to get impacted. So we decided where we want to pay everybody at the level it is, and they don't need to be worried from a financial perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe employees of today have a potent social conscience; they're not only looking at in terms of what you're doing to them. But what you're doing to the larger ecosystem as well. Secondly, we pulled in our increment cycle really fast, assuring our employees that we are there for them. The third thing was that very quickly, we enabled them from an infrastructure perspective. They were ID packs that were kind of built-in in record time and were shipped to employees' homes, which meant that they had all the infrastructure needed to get productive. We quickly introduced a $400 subsidy for people to buy furniture from home to create the right economic environment office environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo I think these helped to nurture a lot of confidence. Lastly, we made our top leadership a lot more visible. We had virtual visits from our CEO \u0026amp; the entire leadership team together communicating 'we are in this together. These things helped us create what I would call an environment of comfort, which was very well received and well appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now, yeah, that is amazing to hear. Because as they say, it's difficult times when humanity comes out. So, I think the social contract that all of us have with each other shows up in these kinds of times. And I think it's it did, in all the cases that you talked about. From the perspective of NVIDIA being a tech company, did you face the situations of needing to rescale, retrain \u0026amp; understand what works, what doesn't work from a talent perspective? How has that changed, if at all, for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, it's not changed significantly for us, other than the fact that now we have a much larger universe to kind of work in. And, it is actually a boundaryless world as far as talent is concerned. And that's a massive plus for us. Most technology companies, including ours, are highly innovative and research-focused but have not had the building blocks to allow employees to work from home. I think the concept was not alien to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhat has changed dramatically is the way work is kind of getting done now. Culture is a big challenge that most of us have. How do you ensure that your culture is experienced by the employees currently operating in a remote kind of environment, especially when we hire more people than we've ever done? In the last year, even if I look from an Indian perspective, our hiring has gone up by 30% from what we've done in the past. From a business perspective, we are getting into new areas, expanding ourselves. A skill set, for instance, that we built over the last year is in the networking space because data centres are a big focus area for us. Over the previous 12 months, we've actually made more investments in newer areas than we've ever done before as well. We looked at it as an opportunity where we could reimagine, re-explore and actually reinvent a lot of the things that we were doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOur hiring has gone virtual. For so many years now, we were trying to, you know, kind of, get technology adoption when it came to recruiting people. We had middling success, I would say. In the last 12 months, I think we have made giant strides in everything that happened; our platforms have gone virtual, the adoption of technology and tools and predictive assessment tools have just kind of gone through the roof. In these 12 months, what we've learned is that that's the easiest part? You no longer have the resistance, you no longer have the criticism, you no longer have a fear of trying something new. And, you know, for instance, I mean, our entire college hiring was done virtually through tools like hacker ranks and some of the other technologies that we're using. It actually broke down some of our deep-rooted construction behaviour that organizations have that the best talent. And we were able to expand our reach efficiently, and instead of having five IDs and 10 NIDs, we could reach out to 120 colleges at the same time, and roughly half of the talent that we hired actually didn't come in from those colleges. And it was a massive paradigm shift for our managers, as well, who said that you know, let's not kind of just focus on the conventional ways of doing things, and let's kind of get a little more unconventional, and there is a goodness to it as well. So, I think many of our paradigms have taken a shift in the last 10 months or so. And change management has never been easier. Digital adoption, self-service models - most companies' kind of struggle with it. And we are not behind because we have a very, very intimate manager centric, employee-centric approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;No, I get that. So now there is obviously a side to it, where the getting feedback in-person feedback, the engagement in, in physical terms used to be kind of the norm earlier? How do you see that play out? You might have gone through reviews and feedback cycle?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Employee surveys are dead. Pile surveys are the way to kind of go forward. We are now doing very, very quick, short pulse surveys every two months. And we are doing it on a thematic basis. Right. In terms of trying to understand what is on top of people's minds. For instance, our first survey was about how you kind of looking at work from home, and what is it that is, what is your confidence level in terms of coming back to work? And what would make you more comfortable? And there were some interesting perspectives that kind of came in there; a lot of people said that I don't mind kind of coming to work, but I'm really, really kind of concerned about the well-being of my family. And my second most significant concern is whether my co-workers are going to adhere to the new working norms. So, it's not about me, I'm confident I'll be able to do whatever you're asking me to do, or whatever I know the government was telling me, but I'm not too sure that my co-workers will be doing that. It was also very, very clear to us that people are saying that we want to kind of, we want to kind of come back in phases. And perhaps the future is that I would 60% of our employees said that I don't see myself coming into work more than two to three days a week for a few hours, and make it more focused and make it more thoughtful as against just coming to work because I am expected to kind of come to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSurprisingly, you realize the millennials and the younger employees are more interested in coming back to work because they were missing the social connection. They want to come back to work because work-office \u0026amp; social interaction is a big part of life. I don't think people are going to be wanting to work from anywhere. I think they will want to work from the location and may not be necessarily from the office. So, there's a lot more flexibility that's going to kind of come in there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOur second poll survey was about collaboration and saying as to whether collaboration is working. There was some intense feedback that came in there saying that keep the business running kind of stuff, things that I'm already doing well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eEmployees are missing interacting with co-workers. They make one-on-one conversations, but that informal, inorganic way of just kind of shooting the breeze is kind of missing. On our end, however, ideation is becoming a challenge. Whenever it comes to new ideas, new projects, we are struggling with that. We're still trying to figure out what's the best way to create that. There are obviously virtual tools to assist some of that brainstorming, whiteboarding, all of that. However, people want what I call shooting the piece, right? Kind of seeing the other person's reaction, the body language makes a big part of how work is done. They are also missing their informal coaching and mentoring, you know, that thing that hey, if I'm stuck with something, something I just walk over to somebody, I get it resolved, and I move on with my life. Today, I have to kind of make a deliberate effort to kind of set up a call, do a meeting, the type of stuff, but it is interesting, right? The way I look at it, you know, three significant shifts that I have experienced are the shift from employee experience that companies are focused on to kind of managing what I call the employee life experience now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThree significant shifts that I have experienced are the change from employee experience to employee life experience, understanding the challenges around parenting, life challenges, and finding ways to help them address them. Mental wellness, a psychological hub in India, our utilization of that has just kind of gone through the muscle gone through the roof.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eInitially in India, you know, people are very, very sceptical to say, hey, if I go to an employee assistance program, there is something wrong with me. Now, that actually kind of look into it as a very, very meaningful tool to kind of help them cope with their life scenarios. The definition of work-life balance has changed dramatically. It's no longer about work-life balance is about work-life integration. Traditionally, it was about giving flexibility to people to kind of work from home. Now people are looking at flexibility in terms of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe had to kind of go and reconfigure all our meeting ecosystem and eliminate many of our meetings. So, I think that the whole concept of work-life is undergoing a shift. I think the other thing that has been significant learning for us, and I think at a macro level, will have implications in the future as well. That I think countries, regions, states, cities are no longer going to be focused on attracting companies to come to their core to them. And the emphasis is going to be in terms of attracting talent to come to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAlso, I think managers are learning new skills as well. Empathy \u0026amp; mindfulness is something that is a unique trait that they would they are being forced to kind of develop. So suddenly, the appetite for behavioural programs, and a lot of managers, you know, have this kind of a little bit of trepidation when it comes to soft skills sort of training has gone up tremendously. And people wanted short, they wanted personalized, and they wanted contextual. So, storytelling will be the most critical skill that the leaders are going to want to need. And empathy is probably the most prominent skill that the managers would have to learn in the future, and I think we got no easy answers for this; I think all of us are kind of learning as we go along.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eTechnology adoption, I think, again, is a given at this point in time, and we're probably going to see a lot more a lot quicker adoption of tools and technologies than we've ever done in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eRecruiting is a low hanging fruit that's already kind of accelerated. Learning and development will follow as well because it's going to become hyper-personalized, almost like the retail shopping experience kind of stuff. And we are going to be required to sort of change the way we kind of deliver training and the kind of training that we do because people are not interested in looking at general principles. They are looking at more contextual stuff.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eService providers would also have to look at how they will make their offerings customized - a lot more flexible and a lot more relevant to clients as against having a big platform that can tweak a little bit here and there. So, these are the big things that we are kind of seeing now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;You referred to the advantages of the boundaryless workforce that you can access now. Within that, obviously, there is this whole gig workforce concept that is playing out as well. In this boundary-less environment, it gives you a more significant opportunity to tap into talent across the VDI environment and your contingent workforce environment unlocked by location. So how is that helping you? And also, from a talent perspective, helping your talent tap into roles and jobs in different parts of the world for them? Right? Is that something which you've seen pick up?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;It's a mixed bag. I am a little worried because it also means that there will be a higher propensity for the US and Europe to start hiring from India. And, as the talent truly kind of, I mean, it's a reality that we would have to kind of contend with. And in some ways, it's a challenge because then we need to sort of up-level our game to make sure that the work that we do is equally meaningful and equally attractive. After all, increasingly, we see that many companies, the US, have now started to hire people from India for jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd, and in some cases, they're paying them US salaries as well. So that's, yeah, that's something that we would have to kind of contend with. I think the other thing that companies must be cautious about is that there are still legal and compliance issues that companies have to deal with as you get people to work from home. It's not that easy for me to kind of get somebody to work from a restaurant. I mean, it looks great. But if he's using my hardware, it kicks in, for instance, some GST implications for us? How will personal taxation kind of work? I think it's more pronounced in the Western world, but increasingly, in India, how do I make sure that I am compliant with the local laws? And in India, we do have a federal structure where each state has its own employment laws. But having said that, I think if I look at the talent behaviour, they have become a lot more open. I hired more people in Delhi last year than I have done in the previous 10 years. Because, you know, it was challenging for us to move people from Delhi. And then suddenly people are kind of attracted by the quality of work by the quality of organization that they're going to be going to work in, under location does not become a significant factor as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eHowever, I think the gig stuff will probably take a little more time to pick up. I think it's still pretty nascent at this point in time. From an Indian perspective, there is a little bit of trepidation. How do I kind of make sure that the person is working for us in the limited time they are working for us, they're giving their 100% kind of totally committed because it's not about just the technical skills? The biggest challenge for companies is the expansion of the skills that you require from your workforce. The more significant trend is re-skilling employees, taking people from their specialized zones and converting them into full-stack. And I think that's the biggest challenge that most organizations would have. And therefore, putting in programs, bringing in technology that understands what the skill map in the company is going to become a significant, big imperative. And I think a lot of us are kind of struggling with it now. And I know your company has some solutions there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think it's a sweet spot at this point in time. It's not external looking. It's not about where the talent lies outside. It is where the skill lies within the company. And how do you kind of utilize that? And with the barriers of location, time zones being removed, I think it's like a huge opportunity, a significant imperative for organizations in terms of how to identify what your skill landscape is and how to do you kind of leverage the underutilized talent within the organization. And I think creating those skill inventories, understanding where they're skill-wise, and how best you can sort of leverage it, and create opportunities for them to do to bring their best to work, I think is going to be big.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Great.

So, despite the awareness campaigns, despite everybody coming up and sharing on social media, especially and Bollywood celebrities speaking out in favour of it, we still see a lot of people going into denial and seeing that they probably don't need it or hesitating, because of some other reasons. So, Arjun and Dr Jyothi, I would like to hear some of the challenges you see daily that individuals hesitate to ask for help?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Statistically, I think there have been a lot more people approaching mental health now. It was 2% of workforce which went up to about 8% of people. But having said that, I think the idea is that people reach out not just to professionals but to each other too. So that's also a critical point of intervention. I believe the professional help avenue is also just by statistics of reference points of the number of therapists doing sessions; I think it must have gone up dramatically. I think that's the aspect that we see and will continue to persist, where people are looking out for a medium of connection and intervention and change. So yeah, and I urge people to reach out. It's just normal. It is essential, and it is necessary to do it now versus doing it two days later. Yeah,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Thanks to the pandemic, mental health professionals are now categorized as medical doctors. So, they will also be able to prescribe medications for the disorders and do therapy. Sometimes we are asked to hide our identity as a psychiatrist and talk to them as a general physician. With celebrities talking about mental health issues, at least the stigma is now coming down. With more online consultations today, we're doing therapy sessions and consultations in remote towns and villages. Also, we can now consult in conference with kids, who are abroad, and their parents.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIdentification is the most important thing because people suffer from sleep disturbances, panic attacks etc. The very sensitive indicator that I can tell every individual is to understand if you're sleeping well. If you have an excellent sleep and your appetite is good, more or less, your mental health issues are sorted. In major mental health issues, sleep is a very sensitive indicator. Sleep deprivation can start a vicious circle of low mood irritation. These days it's challenging to diagnose mental health issues because of excessive mobile phone usage, overwork, and stress. Overflow of news is also an important factor in losing sleep these days. It can be hazardous if people are 24 into seven with the movement; they keep on checking information/news repeatedly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eLet us be productive, focus on our work, immediate family members. So, smaller steps can make a lot of change. Let us at least try to help people, hold hands and speak a few encouraging words.

So, can we take up some questions from the audience?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe first question is for the both of you. So, a dear founder friend had a difficult situation where three of his employees left their jobs and went on long breaks to overcome the tragic loss in their families. And all these three employees were great workers. So, the founder is confused, whether he should reach out to them and hire them back? Or should he leave them? What's your take?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, if they've gone on sabbatical and they've gone out and returned to find themselves and get past that point, definitely reaching out to them to say you're there. And whether they're in the organization or not is essential. I think that's the right thing to do. Whether they can come back because you require them, you can say it the way it is and leave that thought with them. But I think you should also do as a founder because you owe it to yourself and your business and potentially your investors to get on with it. So, you need to figure out how you can get people who can replace their skills and competence are the rules within your organization to get on with it. If they're going to come back, give them the option based on your need, and get on with it to figure out whether you can move with different people coming in and, you know, supplementing in terms of their roles. Also, they have to understand it's not open-ended; you need to get on with it because you owe this to yourself, and you need to or obviously to the company that you're building the dream you have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think first reach out to them. Sometimes people in desperate situations leave their jobs, but they would be in search of another. If they were happy or content with the first job, they would be satisfied, even if the founder would have approached them. But if you know, they are still stating that they can't join or get back and are still very busy with their thing. It is a challenging situation, but he has to keep going by employing maybe new people and going forward, and it should not be seen as a failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I just wanted to add one thing. One of the things that I learned through the journey, through many mistakes and failures, is that self-flagellation, as a founder, you got to own an account for what you have with you, right? It's a context of time. The fact that you reached out and asked this question is a great thing; hopefully, you get some takeaways from this and act upon it. So, there's nothing wrong with you reaching out and saying, listen, are you alright? And nothing wrong with you telling them, if you want to come back within the next month, it would be great for us, and probably getting your head cleared, and then coming back would be great for us. And, you know, I want to be able to take that opportunity to work with you again. If you find an excellent person to take their place in that month you need to communicate that to them through that journey. So you know what, two weeks have happened. And I've met a great person, and I'm sorted right now, and I'm going on; I want to let you know, thank you for being there and sort of thinking of coming back still. But you know, I've got this sorted out, now constantly have to make those tough choices. And one will be, you know, wrong to somebody else, but right to marry other people. And you got to think of that in this, make that decision and live with it. Right. I think you need to deal with the accountability and responsibility of making that decision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eAnother question for Dr Jyothi, in particular, is - can you suggest some practical tips for all the stress and the anxiety that is stored within one's body?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eBroadly, we can classify these coping skills as physical coping skills, emotional coping skills, and social coping skills. So physical coping skills is the utmost that we'll have first to sit and understand whether we are taking care of our body correctly or not. I/f yes, then only the body will be able to cope with the other kinds of stress. And the second is the social coping skills like connecting to other people, trying to be in touch with friends, neighbours, or family members. The third thing is emotional coping skills. Emotional coping skills are different for different individuals. Some people are doing 15 or 20 minutes of physical exercise like yoga or something that rejuvenates them. It makes them feel good because it is like all the muscles in the body are involved. For some deep breathing exercise, like a five minute of breathing in, breathing out, just focusing on the breathing, trying to lessen/ increase the depth of the breath. Concentrating on it for five minutes works a lot in reducing anxiety. For some individuals, it is their hobbies like cooking, arranging, or cleaning up the home. Even these are some activities that reduce our stress and anxiety about household chores.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt is spiritual music for some people. They get a lot of anxiety relief by praying, believing in some higher self, chanting, etc. Whatever works for anyone, I think people can get any coping skill that they can take up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThank you for sharing that.

What are some of the tips you would like to share with entrepreneurs, how they can best manage their resources, which are primarily constrained at these times, like money management or employee retention?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eone of the things that I realized in the journey, and what happened to a lot of startups who were on the B2C side, is that they had to deal with the changes; and we had engagements that our investors conducted for the portfolio companies talking about how they did sessions, usually every day, with the workforce and the employees to keep them connected. And because they're trying times, there was salary restructuring and reorganization rescheduling in various forms and manners. But I think in that time, what I learned was to be connected to your people is very important because you know, whoever you are, is because the people you have, and the sort of the dream will get fulfilled for them with you. So, it would be best to be very clear about that being the connection point for them. Why would they want to go away at this point is very basic, simple things, financial security, job security, the realization of self-worth in their jobs. These are essential things that you need to re-emphasize through this journey. And you might not be able to find ways to provide more financial security. In fact, it might be less financial security, but communication is the key. Lay out a plan and go early on the day with a message because people must understand that you're trying your best to organize this whole thing for them and yourself. Founders have to make that and work on ways to ensure that it is not all about money. People will want to shift to another job or want to move to another company or want to get more salary within your company. You will probably realize what your situation is if you're authentic and straightforward about the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eDon't try and profit from the situation. I'm not saying that that's the motivation for everybody at this point. But make sure that authenticity comes in that sincerity comes in that integrity is something that employees see because they joined you b because you're passionate about doing something within this company and taking your risk with you. Do not forget that. So that's my two cents. I believe strongly in people who built a company around solving the problems of translating the economics around employability and ensuring that people get the right jobs. And being at the goal of empowering and enabling companies to, you know, look at that talent, and then the transparency will give them all the power they need to perform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eDr Jyoti, would you like to add on to it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;No, I think that was very well answered. So being genuine to everyone around the company spirit should never be let down. The founder has to make it very clear to the employees the critical purpose of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I'll give you another insight. I tend to begin my day by getting up at 6:00-6:15 am and then starting to check my email around 7 o'clock. And I'm a big believer in making sure that I get a balance of exercise because that's my de-stress. And I figured out different ways to do it in this lockdown. But as I begin the day, there was an I've been, you know, sort of, you know, trying to push the bar and work through the day. And I've been talking for really long hours, which also affects your eating and all the other things that are not balanced. What I was looking at through the day; this is what other founders and looking at it, they were meeting scheduled like one after another to the degree of it spilling over, and you have to manage your time really. It's something that you can't do anything about your need to be there. And then I had this meeting invite sent to me for 9 pm. Tonight, from 9 pm to 9:45 pm. Tonight, and I was here and saying, why can't this be done on Monday? Right? The fact that my colleague wanted to do that meeting at that time motivated me to say, Okay, I'm going to do that. Because why is someone wanting to do that meeting is because they're so interested about doing that meeting, they want to want to meet on this really relevant topic. Right? It's important. So you need to also figure out through this and condition yourself for it so that you're there for the long haul because it will be a trying time. You need to take these avenues that Dr Jyothi talked about and not be taboo about this word mental. Ensure that you are all right to perform and since this direction setting for all the people out there. It's imperative to realize that while everybody has all these different things happening in their lives, you maintain a sense of balance. And guys, we're all human. So, if you falter a new fall, speak yourselves up but realize it's okay. It's not the end of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eYeah, because this motivation is also contagious. Even if one employee in the companys' been a little bit more motivated, I think he can motivate the rest of them. Yeah, I love the fact that my colleagues are encouraged, and they're, you know, they, you know, it just makes me continue and deliberate and immense, I wake up because they wake up, to be honest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThat's a beautiful way to put that. So, in fact, we've come to the end of our time for today. And I would like to thank both of you for sharing your valuable insights. And it has been such an exciting discussion. And I hope the founders and the employees and everyone, and all the viewers were able to, you know, take back when key points and learned, you know, how to better manage their stress during this pandemic.

And I think we share eternal optimism, which is excellent. Dr Jyothi, I believe, as you said, this too shall pass. And there are better times ahead. It's just a realization that we have to go through that we are responsible for this destruction somehow. It's not the government or not the policymakers alone; I think we need to account for this chaos that has been created. And let's not deflect and displace our emotion. It's really up to us to start figuring it out. Let's start owning that part and getting this in order. And it shall pass, and we will see better times. And that's, I think, the writing on the wall. So guys, hang in there, make sure that you know you don't beat yourselves because you feel like you're alone. Reach out to each other. It's essential to reach out to a friend, colleague, family, have a discussion. It's okay to be angry, it's okay to fight and also feel sad at times. But you know, you're going to move on. And it's not that Dr Jyoti and I are not in pain, or we haven't had our set of setbacks exist, that it's vital to have a positive attitude.

I'm Dr Apoorva Joshi, and I welcome you all to the special session on coping with the stress of the pandemic. And today, I'm pleased to be joined by Dr Jyothirmayi MD \u0026amp; Arjun Pratap. Jyothirmayi is a psychiatrist, and she's an export counsellor. And Arjun Pratap is the founder of a very celebrated startup, EDGE, and he manages a team of young professionals. So welcome both of you. And thank you for finding precious time to join us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, India is currently facing probably the worst pandemic crisis in the world. And as we all know, every citizen has been deeply impacted. As days go by, we are experiencing more and more fatigue. So, coming straight to the point, Arjun, I would like to learn from you as to how the pandemic has impacted the industry and the employees? And what is your experience been like?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eSo, my experience has been around, typically, my startup and my team and my colleagues and peers. And it's quite heartfelt, primarily, because the kind of empathy we required to make sure things are sorted must be with the velocity, with a deepness of understanding because we really started caring for each other in a deeper sense and in a more effective manner. So, when I look at my company, and we did a dipstick on the number of people who had COVID, who are sort of struggling to get tests done, some to get oximeters, some to get CT scans or different medication. It is important to connect the dots for them. So, you have to have channels open. And that's just the context of our company. And what I see is also the empathy movement, for instance, from our investors who come back and say, you know, we have a couple of companies in our portfolio, we are not aware of who also will help on oxygen, or will also help on getting your bed. So why don't you reach out this way? It's very heartening to see them pitching and delivers the message of connecting us to really help and empathizing with our situation. So, I think it is, it is important to recognize what's happening in the industry - companies are stepping up and saying, listen, we will, you know, take care of your vaccines, testing requirements; work from home, don't come to the office, because we are on a lockdown as well. But I think these are interesting times where the people element of the companies are starting to become a lot more real.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you for shedding light on that. And so, how was the year 2020? And what is the difference that you see in the previous year? And in this current year? What are some of the challenges that you are seeing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eIt's a good question because the year 2020-21, in terms of the lockdown phase, is around the same sort of time period. But what we faced in 2020 was this whole view of annihilation and everything falling down. We were all panicking because a lot of things were breaking, a lot of businesses around was crumbling, and there was a lot of job and financial insecurity that was of big concern. So we went through different measures, like terminating our lease, cutting back on hiring and thinking about revisiting the structure of pay scales. Otherwise, how would we manage cash flows? How would we live another day? I think the sense was really April, May, June last year was about how to live, right? This year, if I had to reflect upon it, as a country, a lot more clear about managing it, and then we sort of lost the plot for various reasons. And I think the loss of the plot and coming back to the same state is fatigue. I think we're a lot better placed to deal with it because we have seen it in the past, but what we're dealing with is at a different scale. And that, I think, is the element of challenge that we have, because near and dear ones, every household, every family is dealing with it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Right. Thank you for sharing that. And yes, so every person has been impacted by the severity, and a lot of people have lost the near and dear ones. So Dr Jyoti, what are some of the major challenges that you were seeing in your clinical experience or diseases that people are suffering through because of this current pandemic crisis?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDR. Jyothirmayi MD:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eSee, the world is currently facing a major crisis. But at the same time, when we see the opposite end of the spectrum, we see people who are trying to help in their own way. They are giving their 100% effort in facing the situation and are putting themselves at risk. However, we see rising anxiety in people. 1 out of 10 is coming up with the anxiety symptoms related to COVID or post COVID. This ratio changes to 1 by 5 when we consider the worldwide scenario. So, mental health concerns are increasing by two folds. We wouldn't be humans without our fears. So, whenever there is a fear causing stimuli, the brain simulation centre of our brain called 'amygdala' is stimulated, and our body gets ready for a fight or flight response. However, in the current scenario, the stimulation modes are constantly ringing alarm bells in the body because of the constant overflow of news or negative information. So, the body feels constantly under threat. And it is seen in some physical symptoms of anxiety or\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003epalpitations where the heart beats fast, breathlessness, dry mouth, sweating or coldness of hands or the urge to go to motion. Additionally, people are anticipating and catastrophizing COVID thinking that they or their family members might contract the disease, assuming worst-case scenarios.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd then there are depressive symptoms people are experiencing like sleeplessness, low appetite, PTSD, nightmares etc. Thus, a lot of mental health issues have suddenly cropped up; star employees have suddenly become poor performers, So, it's necessary to address these issues, put everything aside, strive to hold hands and walk together.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I'm glad you raised the point that you know, we are seeing both ends of the spectrum that we have one stratum of people who are going out of their way to help out as much as they can and doing their bit even in service of strangers. And on the other hand, we are seeing survivor's guilt. So, these are two very extreme spectrums. And it's a very unfortunate time that we're are going through this at the moment. So, Arjun, from you, I would like to learn that what were some of the mechanisms that earlier, the employees would be able to do and unburden themselves. But now, it doesn't seem to work for them. So, she pointed out that some of the higher-performing employees might show a drop-down in their performance levels. So what are some of those differences that you've seen?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;In terms of performance and measures of outcomes, I think the idea is to just keep things going, make sure that you continue to interact with a certain level of normalcy, to ensure that other people also don't feel this overwhelming sense of abnormality. Where, where everything is going shit, you don't want that to happen as well, right? I think it's important to try and maintain that sense of control and direction for the people that you're economically taking care of; you need to understand their compulsions of working as well. And certainly not take advantage of it but be there from an empathetic standpoint and manage them through the process. So part of the thing that we did last time was actually engaging them through gamification because all of us were in this digital medium where we were connecting as a way of life, and then that way of life became very, very effective because we could conduct meetings faster, perform better, but what we do not realize that were relegated to so much screen time, which causes fatigue at the backend. So how do you manage that fatigue through mental days off? So I've read a recent article that one of our Product Marketing team and one of my colleagues also brought up from the HR side saying, we should be evaluating this and just, you know, between yesterday and today, we went through a whole thread of what all can we do yoga classes, meditation etc.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eLeaders within the organization who have the responsibility and accountability to lead their functions and teams have to step up to the plate. And they're also going through their own trial and tribulations. Just because they have a leadership role to play doesn't make them superhuman. So this balance is very important. And it can only come if it's a two-way street. We are finally starting to understand that culturally we are a very empathetic society based on our development status.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Very, very well put, Arjun. So like, as I shared that digital served as a medium for people to get an outlet. That was one, and you know, how the company was able to provide counselling, psychological counselling for its employees in the previous year as well. So, Dr Jyoti in you, I would like to learn that what are your key recommendations that, you know, employees and firms and organizations can do in such an extreme crisis?

So, till yesterday everyone was aiming at the higher level of needs. What usually happens is when the basic needs are fulfilled, then only a human being is loved or can think about the higher needs. In the current scenario, the basic needs are unfulfilled, and thus productivity/ creativity/ innovation is low. So here, we need to give that person some space, some time for people who are affected. This is where the organization's role is important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI have seen many big firms organizing employee programs like one-on-one talk with the employees or paying full salaries to those who get affected, And that is giving a boost for them- improving productivity, relieving stress and anxiety. So, I think that is what is happening when the basic needs are fulfilled, then only we can think about the higher needs.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eUsually, human beings have what we call defence mechanisms. So the most common immature defence mechanism that we resort to is displacement. Some people go into denial mode, especially in this COVID; they try to, you know, put aside everything thinks everything is normal, there's nothing much serious, nothing is going to happen and all that. So, the number of preventive measures and all that they take will be less. So, let us not go into denial mode; let us accept that this is the situation and all of us at some of the other quality of time is going to face this. In the employee-company setup, if one particular individual is not able to perform the work properly, maybe others who haven't been affected by COVID can take up that extra work or try to help each other in some way. And the founders and the higher authorities can just sit up with the employees and, on a weekly, you know, call basis, try to encourage them to try to address their issues. I think communication is the key here because maybe we'll have the intent to help them, but it has to be also communicated properly so that they understand the key; these are the resources that are helpful resources available to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Great, ma'am, thank you.

And it's a pleasure to be here talking to 'the' Vikas Baghel, who's one of the members of HCL Technologies, a top-three IT services company globally, has 150,000 people and gives us a complete insight into our experience of what the term supply chain is. And I think in the past, he has been one of the people I've known and, in his experience for the last 15 years, has been sort of managing through our talent supply chain, enterprise social networks, recruitment firsthand, and talent management itself. So, because of his wealth of knowledge, I've learned a lot through my journey as a startup entrepreneur through the eyes of Vikas. And I've seen him in multiple forums, contributing to making sure that you know, employees, the workforce candidates, the entire talent management company is looking to better itself at every curve.

And thanks for having me here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun\u003c/strong\u003e: So, the topic of the conversation today will be, you know, the new talent equation, and I think what we are talking through is returning to the post-pandemic workplace. And I guess it's been beaten to death as to what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. All of us are waiting for the vaccine, but we still don't know what that means for many of us. And if we had to take it to the work 2.0 sort of new normal equation, what are your views on the sort of new work environment that we see today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas\u003c/strong\u003e: I think most of us have said that last year has been about a lot of realization, right, personally, as well as for the organization's I think some of the notions which we had in our head, all of us had a desire to give up from home, but we have a lot of apprehensions and inhibitions about it. One of the things is pandemic days; it cleared some of those inhibitions of some of those pilots we were running at a microscopic scale, we had to suddenly do it by force at a massive scale. And we got those results right! and all of us now realize that some of these are going to be new realities, that work from home perhaps it's going to be new reality and will not be talked as add on you're doing for employees. It will become a new normal. So, in light of doors, many of our organizations are also trying to consider how we should get back to you know if not all, perhaps 25% or 30% employees should come back to the office if they wish to. And I think that is one thing that will come as a post-pandemic trend where a lot of it will be driven by employees' desires. The whole aspect of employee experience will not be bogged down around technology, its tools, or features. It will also be about how the entire structure and the treatment of employees are going to be mated; it'll be about employee experience and the whole self of employee right, physical, financial, and mental well-being. And I think that is one thing which has changed now, earlier when we used to talk about some of these things, we were only talking about a specific section of it when we spoke about the experience with automation, technology, and all of that. However, now when we talk about experience, we are also considering aspects of financial and mental factors and health. So, I think these are some of the things and which are still early trends. But I think if the last year has been about reflection and introspection, this year will be about action for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, you know, honestly, it will give you more credit than you're taking. I think one of the things that I've seen, also through the lens of HCL, is that the fast pace not only bucks the trends but sets the pace too. So, one of the things I want to take this segue, you have been part of the employee first sort of journey. And one of the first companies that did it, at least from an India-centered standpoint, where you put the employee first in the middle of everything. And this was like, what, 15 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo when you look at the journey and look at what that means to you, I think you reflected upon it through technology, the process, automation, or a new tool that you'd give an employee. However, today, it's not about the means or the process; it's more about the engagement, the experience you're developing for them, and what are you catering to ensure that productivity is being achieved for the company as the employee. Right! So I think it's in the centre of that. The trends you see through the lens that HCL has specifically but more importantly, from your lens, because I know you speak very widely on employee engagement. How do you see the employee experience and employee engagement model fitting into a hybrid virtual work model? You do know a lot of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think so many companies have come forth and said that as soon and, you know, and I'm talking about the large corporations who have come forward and said that we are not going to get back to the pre COVID kind of walk engagement where 90% of 90 95% plus workforce are going to be in the office. Most of them have said that it will be a hybrid model because we realize that it works. There's enough data for us to show that productivity hasn't gone down. If anything, perhaps people have worked harder than ever before. And it's a personal experience as well; I'm sure it goes for you too. While we were juggling these many balls - managing the kids, parents, and household chores, we have been delivering the same productivity and, therefore, to say that getting somebody within the four walls and roof for eight hours to do work is a myth. Thus, the hybrid model will be the reality, unless you are in a kind of job or role where you're forced to be in office because of certain compliance norms or the nature of work. However, I don't think there's going to be an employer who will force people to come to the office from now on; it will be on the wheels of an employee if they want to attend office. If that's so, I think there's this other side where people say working from the office is also about connecting with the people you know; when you connect with people, perhaps you achieve more, sort things out, and brainstorm together to come up with a lot of bright and innovative ideas. While many may say the same can be done virtually, it is not the same when you are in a room sitting across from the person. There you can connect at a different level; you can see the emotions, you can see how the other person is behaving. Thus, I think some of those things will be there, and therefore, the hybrid model will be the reality, the virtual will live, and perhaps it will become 60/40. For some, it could be 70:30 - more or less, but I think the realization is there. It is going to be the new norm. As far as experience is concerned, I read this exciting report at the global trend 2020 report. And one of the fascinating data was there to say most of the seats that would consider employee experience to be a vital topic, perhaps 48 to 50% of them. But most of them do not know to say what the benefit of it is? Can the employee experience drive my business outcomes? They can't draw that line. And that's a dichotomy we live in while we understand that, okay, employee experience is essential. And we need to do something about it. But how do I draw that line to say that if I make this investment in employee experience, what will I get out of it, perhaps company output or overall productivity? And that's where people like you will come into the picture, a lot of data analytics, a lot of trend reading, that give some sort of tangible data to people and the industry to say that, yes, there will benefit out of it. And you can draw the line; I think all of us at a gut feeling level know there is a benefit. However, if somebody wants to create some model and framework around it, and you know, table it to perhaps CFOs organization to say, I need this investment. And I think that's where there is a gap today, and we need that we need somebody is helped to sort that out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eOkay, so this is an excellent point for all those startups who are sitting out there and building an effective employee engagement and an employee experience product because, for a large enterprise, it's crucial to draw the line between the ROI and employee experience. So, I think I hear you on that, because, when we go to functions that manage time and supply chain, you're at the segue of really aligning buildability, productivity to allocation and movement, including connecting train to deploy ratios to allocation, which is the same way of drawing that line. And people haven't been able to see through that, and you have this great product that does great things for employees. Hence, it's good to have, but not something that I put in as a line item as part of the annual operating plan. So I hear you on that. And this is also for all those startups out there who are building some great products to draw the line to the ROI. I've experienced it, you know, I'm a great fan of interacting with people across the table, discussion room is like glue when you're talking to people and ideas are flowing. But we don't have that availability today. And I don't know about tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe'll have to figure it out. But we're starting to connect virtually and just make sure that we're trying to work around that missing piece. In my opinion, productivity has stayed together. Even Josh Burson cited this recently that financial security and job security are driving people to work harder, especially in the US, where there have been significant job losses to COVID and what the pandemic has done. Keeping that in mind, productivity is improved for all of us at massive levels. What does the organization benefit from in terms of a cost standpoint is lowering of cost? Is that a mantra that you see as a trend?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;The operating cost has undoubtedly gone down like the travel costs, for example - there has been no travel whatsoever for the last six months. And for companies of size and scale of ours, it is a considerable cost, transportation, for example, cabs, etc., which we provide to our employee. So I think some of those are low-hanging fruits, which all the companies have plugged in more so for the companies like us, who used to work in that model, where we always balance our costs and always keep a very close watch on that. But overall, yeah, as I said, I think there is enough data like the one equal to JustPerson there are people who have done it for the APAC. And all of them have come back saying that productivity has gone up. If not, as people were, you know, doubting to say that it might go down and whatever, for whatever reason. The reason could be the fear psychosis, as you said, there could be people who see that things are not going around. The microeconomic trends are very, very, very devastating, and therefore, people perhaps are working harder than ever before for whatever reason. Still, I think it is also to do with that is one aspect. Another aspect is that most of the employees who were trusted to deliver for the company put their best effort to ensure that we stay afloat. And I think that is the emotion that drove some of those companies, and we have read enough of those stories where companies cut salaries and did well after a few quarters. After that, the wages were reinstated. And I think those are the stories that tell us that the employee and the employer who put up hands for each other, took care of each other and navigated this troublesome time. I think that's the only notion to say that the people who work with you create value for you, while people who interact with your customers/consumers are the people you empower in all aspects, financially, mentally, or physically. And they will take care of you. That's all you need to do as management, as an organization - and the rest of it, they will take care of. I read this fascinating article wherein the author said that the CEO has become a chief empathy officer. They all empathize with their employees so much, putting themselves into their shoes and enabling all those changing the policies, processes, workflows, assuring\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecareer management and development\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;etc. And I think that resulted in a great for many industries. And people have come forward and collectively did great things for companies to navigate through these challenging times. And I think that's, that's a very significant change. Right? We have been talking about it, all the automation technology, and we were also talking about it to say that what will happen to human aspects if that happens? Right? And how will we balance between technology and human right, and that this is a great example, we have never seen the kind of digital disruptions we have seen in the last six months. At the same time, we have never seen the employee engagement levels of being hired in 65% 75 unheard numbers. Yeah, these kinds of numbers have never come for employee engagement and, you know, employee satisfaction. So that goes to show that you know, you can balance out both, you can have a rapid disruption of technology, automation, all of that. And you can, at the same time, you can be more human and empathetic. And as long as you can create the balance of two, you can keep moving forward. Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAnd I think what you guys have done as an industry is a digitization at scale. I believe it has been one of the innovators, early adopters, in taking technology to solve parts of the process. I think many companies are looking at the model that you have and are learning. We hear from Josh that 80% of companies are going to work like professional services, consulting companies, and slash services companies. This is because everything is partly based on automotive companies operating in a pod-based model, a bank is working in a pod-based model, and banks have resource management functions today. I think that part is completely shifted, and I'm very fortunate to work in an industry that will be the next force of truth. So I've learned in that journey, and I think with that lens, I can understand what that means for, say, an oil company to change or pharmaceutical company to change looks like, as you have seen this journey, and you've seen it rapidly growing. You have also been a part of the reason digitization at scale has been achieved within your business. How do you see your employee assistance programs, for instance, as they work from home? Are you providing them with any assistance from the outside to ensure that they don't go into depression or not have issues with family, which are very personal things that we all were worried about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSudden for us, and we have always had that these programs. To be honest, we had this, you know, we had these counsellors who are employed. Once they can reach them at any given point in time to discuss some of those personal aspects - they can take legal help, medical health, psychological health, whatever help they need. We had these massive employee engagement programs, which used to do for the families right there. We used to host this talent show for employees and their families where children or their spouse could participate. People did institutionalize some of those programs. And we started doing these more regularly - virtually because they were going through difficult times. And mentally, it was little taxing for all of us. All the news, which we've been hearing and seeing, the numbers in all parts of the world; we needed to do something to tackle that fear psychosis that was building because of media, and news and all of that was being woven taken care of, and then the employees. So it was an overt communication in many ways, along with these engagement programs, to ensure employees and tell them to say that we are with you, and now and you'll be taken care of in any sort of eventualities. So I think, I think that has helped to a great extent. And we have been very, very proactive in our approach, we kicked our business continuity plan way back in January, I think, last week of January, we could preempt because at that point, last year, November, October, news started coming that something was happening in China and, and all of that. So I think by January, we had this realization that it could explode. So we put up a plan around it. And by the time the lockdown was announced, we were all prepared, we had all things sorted, we were ready to move on the workforce for the virtual model. Thus, we could navigate without many hiccups, not only in India but across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe've been lucky, and, personally speaking, I have been driving these digital transformation projects for a while. And all of them have helped. So when we were in complete lockdown all those technologies in the workflows and the design, which we have built over the years, it just kicked in, you know, with a snap of a finger and all our recruitment got virtual - onboarding, the candidate sourcing everything went virtual. It seemed like we were doing some sort of prototype for this kind of eventuality. It all became a blessing in disguise for us. And even the adoption has gone up, suddenly, we don't need to push anything, right? All the users started adopting the technology because they had no choice; they were in that kind of environment. So overall, you know, it worked out. When all our designs and programs are always built with that kind of eventuality - horizontally, we never build anything for the short term. Whatever we have we had created, it fits well for the situation we were in as an organization. And overall, it turned out well for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;In my view, you can redefine through the use of scrap. And I think the redefinition has been very successful because of your ability to consume technology beforehand, looking at different scenarios. And, you know Tom should have taken a leaf out of your book and done something for America. Having said that, I hope other people who are listening to it will take a leaf out of your book. I think your immediate response to the situation had been that much better since you had already played out some of these scenarios and taking into consideration some of these technologies as a path forward. So even in your thinking, just accelerating it in terms of genuine digitization at scale was really about the numbers you're playing out and the actions you're taking today because of what you've done, allowing you to do much better things going forward. So keeping that in mind, I think because a lot of aspects in terms of thinking from a strategic standpoint with talent supply chain are literally because you're taking care of 155,000 people across the board, managing them through this entire plan. In terms of the security, their purpose, their direction, and their commendable growth is something even I can't imagine. But I'm looking at 100 people in Edge and thinking about what that went through - we were going through sleepless nights, wondering what that would mean. And, you know, multiply that with the number that you have. It's just unimaginable. So hats off to you guys. The other thing that I wanted to highlight and talk about as we close this session is the gig economy and its workforce. We've heard this across that Gen Z and the millennial forming sort of the talent marketplace as we speak, and work product becoming more shorter, more short of space to how it would fit into an outcome. And there would be multiple pieces that sort of fit into the puzzle. What is that gig workforce represent to you, and how would you leverage the power of that going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eWe employ close to this - to put the numbers 8 to 10% of our workforce will be in that mode. And as you said, going forward, perhaps that number will only grow up. Because we're not working on some of these programs, where it's taking, you know, a woman who wants to come back to work and therefore, that in the real sense, it's got to be a gig where if somebody wants to work for two hours, or three hours a day, they should have that kind of facility. And I think that's a trend in the market as well, right? If we look at, you know your hobbies a few years back, your hobby today, and if that can become your profession as well. Some people write blogs and get paid for it, some give guitar lessons and get paid for it. And I may be out here for my hobby, but today I can earn money there, Youtube is a job, right? I create a video out of my hobby, and I'm gaining because of that. So somebody is a YouTuber on Saturday, and he's an employee of a company on Monday. So I think that will be a new reality because of all the trends, platforms, and technologies that are emerging. And therefore, you will always have more and more people who would be interested in doing multiple things - I may not like to do eight hours every day, five days a week, the same thing, I would like to do some three days, I want to do something else two days, I want to do something else. And if that is the scenario, the companies have to give that kind of flexibility to their employees, right. Otherwise, you will lose out on particular adequate talent segments, which you don't want, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier, we used to only talk about build and buy right, either you hire somebody, or you retrain/rescale somebody internally using\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/mobility\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etalent acquisition and management tool\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, This whole piece where you go ahead and take some of these people for a stipulated timeline to deliver your project and get done with it, is new. And then those people move on to the next assignment, and it will be a new reality. The whole aspects of those critical projects, which are short term, very time-intensive, high skilled resources, are required, which you may not need for your larger context. Sports teams where you source different players from different parts of the world create a Manchester United for a season when an EPL and then all those people go back to their countries and play their play for their countries. But just for that tournament, they get assembled as a sports professional sports team. Something like that will happen within companies, right? You will have those exceptional individual subject matter experts get together for six, eight months on a project to deliver the same in. Then they will go back to their work either within the company or outside the company. So I think the gig is gonna be the new reality because of these recent trends which are emerging. And I think most of us are still contemplating, at least in India, we are still at the stage where companies consider how I should put a framework around it? Okay, today, we are just consuming it in one pattern in one manner. Now people have started thinking to say okay because I'm not doing it at scale, I'm missing out on something. And therefore, I need to put some structure, some policy or processes around it to tap into this market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eBrilliant.

And that's a great analogy of getting somebody to put a team together to go, and we'll win an EPL, and then sort of go back and play for your country. And I know, if I had to drop back to working in 60 odd countries, you continue to use that flavour of working. And now I'm sure, you know, for people who are going to watch this. It's about following and learning from what are the trends to manage this process going forward; there's going to be a lot of insight because if you provide through many of your interactions across social media that allow people to learn from, you know what that means for the future of work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for a great session - it has been a pleasure as always interacting with you and picking your brain.

The successful transformation of a behemoth and the unthinkable change he infused into Microsoft’s culture, practices, structure and strategies is the stuff legends are made of. Pundits will point out how Satya Nadella also created over US$250 billion in market value – making Microsoft the most valuable company in the world for the first time since 2002.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most fascinating aspects that inspired Nadella’s journey is the Growth Mindset Culture which he often speaks and writes about. Inspired by Carol Dweck, a well-known psychology professor at Stanford known for her work on the growth mindset, Nadella harnessed her insights for his company’s culture change and ultimate turnaround. Dweck says that a company that cannot self-correct cannot thrive. This assumes greater significance today when most organizations are increasingly adopting technology in the digital age, making transformation obligatory and sometimes even mandatory for survival.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis has resonated deeply with me. For only a culture that embraces change with an open mind, learns from failure and focuses on being collaborative can truly transform itself.  Such an environment helps employees unlock their potential for both personal and professional success. In short, without a doubt the growth mindset will define who wins the digital race!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLearning From Microsoft’s Success\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUnder Nadella’s able leadership and sponsorship, the talent team at Microsoft has developed growth-oriented business priorities, culture aspects and organizational systems for its workforce of 131,000 employees across the world. Digital transformation made clear that a state of perpetual learning would be necessary for employees at all levels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGiven what we know about the science (and neuroscience) of storytelling, teams at Microsoft designed interactive online modules with rich multimedia for employees to learn about growth mindset. Conversation guides were built for managers to enable meaningful exchanges about what growth mindset behaviors look like in team settings. Leaders engaged in storytelling to give examples for growth mindset thinking and action.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eR\u0026#038;R programs were designed to celebrate successes which demonstrated growth mindset behaviors. Powerful employee engagement programs and training solutions (such as games, quizzes, lending libraries with curated books, mobile empathy museum, and environmental creative assets) were leveraged to engage employees around growth mindset behaviors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe list goes on and a complete overhaul followed. All Microsoft employees across levels embraced and contributed to building growth mindset habits, processes and environments that soon permeated the everyday culture at the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy This is Important For All of us\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easy to see that by welcoming new ways of working and thinking, we can develop a disruptive approach and take advantage of its competitive edge. This becomes the driving force behind ahead-of-the-curve products, iconic work cultures, immense goodwill and reputation, and enhanced market value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA growth mindset has been identified as one of the 10 intelligences that will gain prominence in the AI workplace.  In a recent industry research project, it has been found digital transformation to be the leading business driver for organizations adopting a growth mindset. The report, entitled “Growth Mind-set Culture,” shows that 38 percent of organizations rely on growth mindset for such purposes. Today, leaders across the corporate world are embracing it and having conversations with their teams.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eClearly what these leaders understand is that big changes require an open mind \u0026#8211; and an enabling culture to bring ideas to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital technology has stolen the limelight in global businesses over the last decade. Unprecedented connectedness, automated and cognitive interactions, and advanced analytics that extract incisive insights from huge volumes of data significantly influence customer behavior and loyalty. Taken together, they have accelerated change and disrupted models to create brand new markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn such a rapidly changing landscape, a growth mindset brings a totally different attitude to work — failure becomes learning, feedback becomes an opportunity, challenges lead to innovation and problem-solving drives development and growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis article was written by Pritha Sen (Head or Corporate Communications for EdGE Networks Pvt Ltd.) and originally hosted on Entrepreneur India.  \u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"growth-mindset-in-the-age-of-digital-transformation","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eI’ve been a big fan of Satya Nadella’s leadership style.

You’ll come back with a fresh dose of energy, a clear mind and motivation to work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-8216\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg?resize=300%2C164\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"164\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/3.jpg?w=303\u0026amp;ssl=1 303w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e4. Add colour to your work-life\u003c/strong\u003e: Psychological studies have found out that colours have a profound influence on our mood and energy. One way to drive away the motivation blues is to add more colour into your workspace. Post some colourful notes on your pin board, or pin some of your favourite pictures. Get some really quirky and jazzy stationeries for your desk. You can also try adding more colours to your wardrobe. Style yourself up. You can also add a small flower vase or a plant to adorn your desk.

As per an IBM report from December 2016 titled “10 Key Marketing Trends For 2017,” 90 percent of the world’s data was generated in the preceding two years at the rate of 2.5 quintillion bytes of data a day. That number has only been increasing since then.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"640b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eOrganisations are fast realizing that this massive data, if used prudently, can bring immense benefits. It can improve decision-making, drive greater efficiency and inform strategies for future growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d4fa\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eOne consequence of this has been the steadily growing demand for data scientists and analysts, who can analyse the data and generate actionable insights from it. The McKinsey Global Institute estimates the that US could have as many as 250,000 open data science jobs by 2024. Closer home in India, a study by Edvancer and Analytics India Mag found that the number of new analytics jobs advertised per month increased by almost 76 percent from April 2017 to April 2018. Even our own research confirms this. When we harvested and processed data from millions of job descriptions across market, we found that the demands in data science are increasing at a rapid rate. If we were to look at a location-wise trend, Bangalore stands on top as the hub of machine learning and AI, covering 34% of total jobs created.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8823\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eBy all accounts, data is poised to play a massive role in shaping the future of industry, and possibly the future of humanity itself. Therefore, a career in data science certainly makes for an attractive proposition for any aspiring engineer. The glut of courses in data analytics, AI, machine learning etc. points to the growing popularity of data as a career option.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"ed80\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eWhile the interest in data science is certainly welcome, I have found that there isn’t enough clarity among students and young IT professionals on what it takes to prepare for a career in data science. A common mistake people make is to enrol in online courses that are either too basic or vague to be useful in practice. The danger there is that these courses are likely to get you stuck in dead-end data analytics or AI jobs that are repetitive and provide no scope for learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d632\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eIn this article, I’d like to share some tips and advice on what constitutes the right preparation for a fulfilling career in data science.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"080b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eBefore we jump into the professional qualifications/skills required, we need to look at some of the basic traits or qualities that a person needs to possess to thrive in a competitive industry such as data science.

Rather, you will likely get your best insights by studying patterns and trends in the reams of data. The ability to find these patterns or anomalies needs a certain basic curiosity and knack for looking beyond the obvious.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"823f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e2. Reasoning\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"dd1b\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eWhen dealing with multiple parameters and data sources, trying to find the exact correlation and causation for any parameter can be confusing and fairly challenging.

It’s difficult to accept failure, especially when you put your heart and soul into something, but patience is what will get through it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"a49f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e5. Love for Mathematics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8175\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eNeedless to say, a lot of data science boils down to mathematical and statistical analysis.

Each generation has different requirements and needs when it comes to what they look for in a job and the way they work. They also have different mindsets and ways of thinking that are unique to them. However, at times because of their differences conflict and miscommunication can arise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHaving a range of generations working in your business is a great thing. It gives your business the ability to understand how each generation works and thinks. This helps in terms of marketing and product creation as your business will be able to appeal to a wider range of customers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEach generation has its own stereotype attached to it, this at times can be one of the reasons why conflict can arise. Traditionalists are considered old by younger generations much like grandparents, which at times can result in younger generations underestimating their years of experience. This works the other way too where the older generation thinks that the younger ones aren’t as hardworking as them and think of them as children who don’t really know what they’re talking about rather than as co-workers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCommunication is one of the biggest problems that the generation gaps can result in. Nowadays millennials and gen Z communicate using a range of apps such as snapchat, instagram, etc. which older generations don’t know how to use.

You can find baby boomers, Gen Xs, Gen Ys and Millennials all under one roof, often even in the same team. Hope you can already sense the dilemma and chaos that managers and leaders face while managing such a diverse workforce.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe diversity owing to varied age group give rise to an unconscious bias and set of challenges. Imagine a team where you have people from all sets of age group, from the Gen Zs (fresh college grads), Gen Ys (the 90’s born), Millennials (born in the 80’s), Gen Xs (the 70’s born) and the Baby boomers (the 60’s born). Every generation has a different approach towards work and learning, different priorities and ideologies when it comes to workplace culture and expectations. Evidently, there’s a looming generation gap, which often leads to discrepancies in the team and lack of productivity and efficiency.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile for Gen Y and onwards, workplace satisfaction, work-life balance, digitization, tech savvy workplace, flexibility, learning on the go (preferably self-paced), etc. matters a great deal. Whereas, for those from Gen X and Baby boomers give a higher priority to traditional workplaces practices, paper-work and classroom-based learning. These are just some of the differences that can be noticed. And all these lead to creating pre-conceptions among the employees about their peers from different generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow the question before the managers is how to deal with such a diverse workforce. You cannot neglect any of these sections of the workforce, for you need the experience and prodigy of the Baby boomers and Gen X as well as the fresh and out of the box ideas and the go-getter attitude of the Gen Y, Millennials and the Gen Zs. So, how do you get all of them work together in a team, as a team? Let’s look at some ways you can master the game of overcoming generational issues with your team and lead it on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFind commonalities:\u003c/strong\u003e Find more common elements in the team and keep focusing on them rather than pointing out the differences.

Establishing a sense of commonness will build collaboration skills as well as trust across the generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvoid stereotyping and labelling:\u003c/strong\u003e As a leader, it is important that you avoid differentiating or labelling your team based on their age group. This creates an unwanted bias and discrimination, which the team members often find disturbing. All ending up hurting the team spirit and productivity at large. Instead, your goal should be to bring the team together despite their generational and mindset differences. This way you can make the age gap seem insignificant and focus on building a stronger and focused team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearning \u0026amp; mentoring sessions: \u003c/strong\u003eYou can organize occasional mentoring and learning sessions to bridge the learning and development gaps. It is essential that the team has an active participation in these sessions, not only in terms of learning skills but also mentoring each other to be at par. Both the younger and older generations have a lot to mentor and train one another. While the older generation is storehouse of significant insight of career growth, organizational values and culture, the younger generation is a Pandora’s box of knowledge of new technologies and gadgets alongside fresh and innovative ideas. A collaborative exchange of knowledge is a sauce that you add to cook the perfect team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMix and match:\u003c/strong\u003e While making teams for projects keep a balanced mix of the generations so that you have the right skills at every level. Let everyone have a fair chance of leading and planning. The more opportunities they have to expand their horizons, the less the age differences will matter. Let the skill decide the project lead not the seniority based on age or years of service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne size fits all no more:\u003c/strong\u003e Gone are the days when the one-size-fits-all rule could be applicable. It is the age of customization and individualization and same applies when it comes to setting annual goals and evaluations too. Thus, bid adieu to the one-size-fits-all managerial approach. Instead, manage people differently based on their individual goals, abilities, and strengths, while maintaining human resources parameters. Evaluate employees based on who they are, not based on the generation they belong to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVariety and diversity are important elements in building a team as it brings in a wider range of both soft as well as technical skills on the plate.

The popularity of AI is undoubtedly going up rapidly. 61% of businesses said they implemented AI in 2017 as per a report from Narrative Science and National Business Research Institute (NBRI).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"bff3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eIt is safe to say that every organization can benefit immensely by using AI, whether to support strategic decision making or increase revenue and sales or provide superior customer experiences. From Netflix using AI to predict its customers’ viewing preferences to the UK news agency Press Association (PA) using robots and AI to cover and write local news to John Deere using advanced machine learning algorithms to help agricultural decision-making, there is a variety of real-life AI case studies that we are seeing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"1545\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eAs a leader, finding the right AI strategy for your organization is certainly an important step, considering that it could have far reaching consequences for the future of your business. But before you jump headlong into implementing AI for your organisation, there are a few critical aspects to consider which will enhance your chances of success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"d03f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eHere are five questions that every leader must ask before embarking on an AI implementation in their organization.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"8ffc\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e1)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003eDo you have a basic, functional understanding of AI?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"51ce\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eDespite all the buzz around AI, there is often very little understanding among leadership teams as to what it really means, and how it can help their business. ‘Artificial Intelligence’ is simply a catchall term that refers to intelligence demonstrated by machines, as opposed to the ‘natural’ intelligence displayed by humans and other animals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"256a\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eJust like all the other technology buzzwords of our time, such as IoT or Big Data, AI is not a magic bullet that magically cuts costs and bumps up sales. There are several layers and degrees of complexity involved when it comes to implementing AI. Therefore, it is important to have a basic understanding of how AI works, and what it can and cannot do before considering it for your organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"7525\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e2)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003eHave you identified the business problem?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"0b66\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eWhile considering the many possibilities of what AI can deliver for your organisation, it is also important to keep the focus firmly on the business challenges that your organisation needs to address. Defining the problem statement accurately and putting metrics in place to determine the success of the implementation is the first and most important step. It is only then that you can effectively judge if AI is the right approach for you, and how you should use it for your organisation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"07e0\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eAlso, AI is still not a mature technology. It is evolving constantly. Therefore, it is important to understand what AI can and cannot do on the ground. For example, can AI transform your entire organizational culture? Probably not, at this stage. On the other hand, if you are looking at improving productivity, then AI may be the answer. Asking the right question is important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"983f\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e3)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003eCan your current infrastructure support an AI implementation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"eba9\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eIn most AI applications, especially those based on Machine Learning, the success of the implementation often hinges on the volume and quality of data available. The effectiveness of data depends on existing data governance processes and the current state of digitization within the organization. If the data that you are generating is incomplete or unreliable, then any machine learning output from this data is also likely to be severely flawed. So, before you rush into an AI implementation, ensure that your infrastructure is equipped to provide the right amount of data and also, the right kind of data. If not, focus on fixing the digital infrastructure before you get started on AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"e889\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eIf your data is less than perfect, AI could also help in the data acquisition process to create quality data. For example, it can capture images and analyse them to generate useful data points that enhance the data quality, compared to data that has been collated manually and is subject to human errors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"6dcd\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e4)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003eDo you have the right team in place?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"fcb3\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eThe right team can mean the difference between success and failure in any technology implementation. Does your company have right team to successfully complete an AI-based implementation? You might want to consider hiring a good AI consultant to help you put in place an AI plan. You will also need to hire data product managers and citizen data scientists to act as functional consultants to determine the right kind of AI for your company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"97ea\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eTraining your employees with high-quality courses on AI such as this one can be considered.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"2f0c\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003e\u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003e5)\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong class=\"markup--strong markup--p-strong\"\u003eAre you prepared to make the Investment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"32c8\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eHowever, like most technology implementations, AI needs a fairly large investment of time, money and resources, which may put considerable strain on the company bottom line, at least in the short term. Is the organisation in a position to make this investment? Also, there is always a certain risk of failure that comes with any technology implementation, and AI is no different. You need to understand and accept that there is a learning curve involved and failure is a part of the journey.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp id=\"635e\" class=\"graf graf--p graf-after--p\"\u003eGiven its incredible power to transform businesses, AI definitely needs to be a priority for any organisation that wants to stay competitive in the long run.

On boarding is very important as it plays a crucial role in shaping the attitudes of new hires. Whether we like it or not almost everything now is being digitized and taken online. So, here are the three reasons why the process of digitally onboarding employees can work as an advantage to your business.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1.Saves time\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen onboarding manually the process can take up to three to four days to complete. However, if done digitally it could be completed even before your new hire begins work. Filling out paper work and completing formalities can take a while, so why not have it done in advance. Before an employee arrives, a business can set up a lot of things online, such as training which, if done when they start work would take up time that could be used more effectively. Businesses can also set up online mentors and make the company handbook and other resources such as podcasts and blogs available digitally so that employees can get an understanding of the business environment and what would be expected of them. All of this not only saves time but makes their transition into the company smooth and allows them to start work on what is important as soon as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xUPGcq6cAnpcLz0lZm\" width=\"480\" height=\"268\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.Saves money\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNot only will the process of digitally onboarding save you time, but money too. Considering how long the onboarding process can be, financing these processes could cost a lot. Financing the training of new employees, as well as the cost of assigning a mentor and having new hires adjust and adapt to their new work environment can work out to be cost ineffective and negatively impact the productivity of your business. By making these processes digital your business can save resources and allocate funds more effectively.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xTiTnqUxyWbsAXq7Ju\" width=\"400\" height=\"480\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.Increases productivity\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy changing your businesses onboarding process from manual to digital, you not only save time and money, but you will see a hike in the businesses productivity too. Onboarding manually creates lot of unnecessary time and money consuming processes that can be avoided. By onboarding your businesses digitally, you will have more control over what goes on as it enables such processes to be streamlined. You will also be able to create more personalized onboarding experiences for different kinds of employees that will help in aligning new hires with the goals of your business. This way they will also be familiar with everything once they start work, eliminating wastage of resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/kBhgPVLVQzpXa\" width=\"480\" height=\"441\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are multiple onboarding software’s that your business can use to customize and streamline your onboarding process. Either that or your business can create its own custom onboarding portal. Having portals where in which new hires can upload documents, references, etc. and fill out mandatory forms can be very effective. As not only will everything be in one place but will be easily accessible to everyone. To give new hires an insight into the workings of your company, you can create and upload videos for them to watch. Rather than having all new hires come in for orientation which can be very lengthy and isn’t likely to be effective. Keeping with the times, another option would be to create a virtual reality experience which would allow your new employees to truly get a feel of what the business environment is like. Businesses need to remember that the onboarding experience is crucial and will impact the way employees perform.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ciframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3otPoEvMyH2X0NTOWk\" width=\"480\" height=\"198\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you like our article and would like to share your views, please drop your comments bel\u003cem\u003eow.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-7348\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Azara-1.jpg?resize=136%2C175\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"136\" height=\"175\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; color: black;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAzarah Singh\u003c/strong\u003e is currently an intern at EdGE \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\"\u003eN\u003cspan style=\"color: black;\"\u003eetworks and will be going on to study business management and entrepreneurship. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"3-reasons-digitally-onboarding-employees-best-business","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eThe process of onboarding involves integrating a new employee into a business by helping them familiarize themselves with the day to day operations of a business, its clients as well as the products and services it offers.

The digital employees demand the same quality experience at an organization that its customers would. They believe in result driven processes and value work satisfaction to the supreme. It has thus become essential for organizations to foster a more engaged, energized and productive workplace culture to tend to the needs and demands of the next-gen workforce.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe communication shift\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026#8211; The overall shift in workplace behaviour and culture has also brought about changes in the way employee communication takes place at organizations.

The approach has shifted to a two-way communication approach where everyone’s voice and opinion in given due importance. The digital generation demands a substantial indulgence in strategic planning and decision-making activities. Social media and chatbots are their favourites.

This is when an employer doesn’t pay an employee what they owe- be it by withholding their overtime dues or illogical deductions. But one very common problem that employers face, but are not sure how to address is employee time theft. ‘Time theft’, sounds funny, isn’t it? However, funny as it may sound, this has a direct impact of an employee’s performance and the organization’s business.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmployee time theft refers to an employee getting paid for the work he/she hasn’t done. This could be by asking someone else to do your work and earn credit for it, or by asking someone else to clock him/her in before actually showing up at work (buddy punching). Or, doing other activities (like reading novels, watching movies, etc.) at work. There could also be unintentional cases like when an employee forgets to clock in their break times, or so on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAccording to the American Payroll Association, employers lose 4.5 hours per week per employee in time theft. \u0026nbsp;An independent survey reports that 43% of hourly workers admit to time theft. A few minutes here and there may not sound fatal, but when added up it could be a hefty price that employers are paying for work not done.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere are a few ways how you as an employer can check time theft by your employees:\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet clear company HR policies:\u003c/strong\u003e Make a clear definition of time theft in the HR policies and state the time theft policies in the company handbook for employees. Many a times, employees do not even realize that some of their actions might constitute time theft. A clear perspective might help in realization and stating the consequences will help in curbing such uncalled-for practices at workplace. Also, it is very important to adhere to the policies and follow strict disciplinary actions when an employee is caught stealing time despite the clear objectives.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProvide time-management training\u003c/strong\u003e: Most of the employees struggle to manage time adeptly and thus end up in time theft without intending to do so. Providing time management training as a part of the corporate training modules would help them make proper use of their time and help in curbing time theft at workplace.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet employee goals\u003c/strong\u003e: Another useful tactic to check time theft is setting employee goals or targets. Employees with clear objectives of achievable goals are found to perform better and end up wasting less time at work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIntroduce flexibility\u003c/strong\u003e: Work-life balance is a key factor for employees, especially the younger generation. The more flexible arrangements you provide at work, the less they are going to spend on personal matters. Studies have also affirmed that companies with better flexibility at workplace also witness a higher performance morale among employees. A win-win situation for all.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSet good examples\u003c/strong\u003e: Last but not the least, you as an employer or boss must set a good example for your employees to follow. When employees/juniors see their seniors or managers, who are often their role models at work, adhere to the company principles and discipline, they feel inspired and follow the same path. Likewise, when they see the leaders not living by good examples, they seem to develop a misconception.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat practices make great teams.

It requires a well thought out plan with leadership buy-in. Some of the factors that must be put in place are: ratio of permanent staff to on-demand staff, identifying jobs for both groups, output measurement mechanism, payment terms, data security and remote management.

The result is complementary skills blended to use the strengths of both types of intelligence, and even physical capabilities, to fill in other’s weaknesses. The following examples of successful machine-human collaboration show how it can be a win-win:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe computer game Foldit uses machine-human collaboration, in addition to collaboration between humans, to fold simulated proteins. The folding is an attempt to understand how real-world proteins involved in the causes of human disease are formed.

As the workforce becomes more fluid to better leverage gig and contract workers to help meet skills shortages, effective teaming will become critical. The future workforce will be liquid: teams will come together ad hoc as required and be expected to be productive immediately. By suggesting team structures and hierarchies, Artificial Intelligence will prove as an essential enabler for this transformation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eEngage employees\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nAdvanced sentiment analysis technologies are using NLP (natural language processing), text analysis, biometrics and other evolving technologies to go beyond outdated ways of assessing employee experience and seeking deeper insights into behaviors and motivations of employees.

However, these can turn out to be costly errors that have the power to ultimately undermine the growth that you want to achieve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe priority for new CEOs and leaders is almost always maintaining and expanding the business – sometimes ignoring the importance of building a capable and trusted team of people as the backbone of the undertaking. The finer points of hiring, firing, optimizing and developing members of the team are often viewed as issues that can be dealt with as the situation present themselves.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSadly, in the ever evolving and complex world of HR, this simple, intuitive approach is rarely sufficient and can lead to serious problems down the line. In fact, a proactive approach to HR is highly recommended, giving you the opportunity to recognise and rectify issues before they become unmanageable or financially unsustainable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eArmed with this knowledge and a little preparation, you can easily avoid the five most common mistakes and ensure that both you and your employees have everything required to push your business forward.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#1. Hurried Hiring\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTake some time to think about why you need new talent to staff a role, what your expectations are and what your new hire’s expectations could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAvoid a “quantity over quality” approach and choose the best candidate that matches the position rather than the best candidate on paper. A very common mistake is to assume the candidate with the most eye-catching CV is a natural fit for the job. Avoid this trap by crafting a comprehensive job description that values skills and experience but also desirable personality and business culture traits. Additionally, where possible, conduct interviews with a trusted partner (or similar) so you can view the candidate from two perspectives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#2. Inadequate Information\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eBe honest with the candidates you are interviewing and share all the information they need to know. It could include, the current state of the business, growth plans, company culture and leaders, salary and perks, what the role entails, manager and team, and what success looks like.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTransparent HR policies are the fundamental stepping stone to a comfortable workplace environment and experience. They are there to protect both you and your employees, covering everything from acceptable working times to how an employee will be recognized and rewarded. Additionally, they should also comprehensively detail disciplinary and grievance procedures. Failure to do this properly can leave huge grey areas that may be exploited by all parties and lead to many problems. Sharing information across the organization and being honest with your employees is an important touchstone of a successful employer-employee contract.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#3. Lop-sided growth\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile you may be focused on growing your business, you could be ignoring the development of your greatest asset, your employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew leaders must remember that employees are an investment. By helping your staff to grow professionally, you are in turn investing in your company and encouraging growth. Alongside your onboarding process, regular professional development programs and training events should also form part of your company curriculum. Take note, inadequate employee training simply makes everyone’s life more difficult and creates a feeling that new hires are insignificant and unimportant.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#4. Toxic culture\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA toxic company culture will erode an organization from its core by paralyzing its workforce, diminishing its productivity, halting virtually all innovation and curtailing its enthusiasm for serving customers. A \u003ca href=\"https://www.nbrii.com/blog/foster-employee-engagement-employee-satisfaction-workplace/\"\u003estifled, oppressive workplace environment \u003c/a\u003eis possibly the most powerful signal of a toxic culture, as well as the presence of aggressive behavior and negativity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAggressive behaviors can be indirect, taking the form of hostile jokes and teasing and/or undermining the work and accomplishment of others. Shouting, ridicule, excessive criticism, bullying and scapegoating are all hallmarks of a toxic company culture. When an organization embraces blame as a blood sport, it is safe to say the company is in peril. Negativity permeates the organization, eroding the morale of the workforce and leading to chronic anger and anxiety among the staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e#5. Rapid Firing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMuch like the hasty hire, the hasty fire can be equally damaging to your company for a number of reasons. Take a step back and consult with your partners on how best to go forward with any problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, if you’ve followed our advice regarding training, terminating staff members essentially means money down the drain. While not always possible, try to find alternative ways to deal with conflict. Salary increases and better benefits might solve the problem, but so too relocation or even home working. Just because you cannot work with an individual on a daily basis doesn’t necessarily mean they cannot benefit your company, so try thinking outside the box to solve your issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith these pointers, some groundwork and HR policies you can quite easily avoid the most common mistakes and ensure that both you and your employees have everything required to forge ahead and take your business to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eIf you like our article and would like to share your views, please drop your comments below.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"avoid-5-hr-mistakes-scale","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eWhen you are growing rapidly or focused on scaling your business, HR missteps often slip from the radar.

Assess your employees’ potentials well and provide them various diverse opportunities and responsibilities to keep them happy and engaged at work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrioritize Fun \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFun at the workplace sounds easier than it is. At the ground level, keeping fun a priority in office could be challenging. However, one could keep a check on how much time and effort that’s going into fun and creativity should receive during work hours by checking on the overall employee morale. If you are noticing that the general work environment is grumpy, dull and low, frequent breaks for fun and creative activities could immediately boost up the workplace energy. Give your employees a chance to enjoy themselves. You will eventually notice an overall healthier and happier office environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOffer lifestyle perks\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the millennial workforce embraces digital technologies to be efficient at work, they expect organizations to be flexible with working hours without compromising on compensation. Irrespective of the fact that they are beginners in their career or otherwise, for the new-age workforce, quality of life at work and post-work are of equal importance and keeps them motivated. Offering flexibility to suit employees’ need will also work out as a great people retention strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealth and wellness are also areas of interest to employees now and organizations would do well to provide free fitness and meditation classes, healthy food options, intramural sports and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncourage entrepreneurial talent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would you include in the team to lead your next big project – an employee who is self-motivated and enthusiastic or the one who works great at following orders and instructions?

There is no doubt that self-motivated employees are a great inspiration for co-workers as they drive everyone around them to perform and push their limits just like they do. They are creative thinkers and take complete onus to lead their team and company to success. Their enthusiasm at work is so contagious that they set great examples for freshers and other employees. So, ensure that you create an environment for such talent to flourish and succeed. It will do wonders for your organizational growth too!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to the Business and Professional Women’s Foundation, by 2025, 75 percent of the workforce will be made up of Millennials.

Most teams spend a lot of time preparing for and executing meetings, which is something AI can easily fix. By quickly sifting through an employee’s computer, AI can identify all files, emails or messages relevant to a meeting. So, robots aren’t taking our jobs, but artificial intelligence is making it easier than ever to do them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne out of three workers believe AI intelligence will see an upsurge in the job market soon, with millennials feeling particularly hopeful, revealed CCS Insight\u0026#8217;s most recent employee enterprise review.

Not only will AI enhance managers’ work, but it will also enable managers to interact with intelligent machines in interconnected ways. As the debate on AI taking away human jobs continues, most leaders acknowledge “short-term displacement,” and agree the long-term economic benefits outweigh the near-term consequences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe key to minimizing the impact to jobs is to educate workers on how to leverage AI so they can focus on more strategic and high-value skills.

The millennial workforce is also known to take pride in donning several hats. If experimenting with different roles at work brings job satisfaction to them, encourage and enable it.

Automation has made day-to-day banking more efficient and simpler. We don’t need a teller anymore to help us deposit money or cheques at a bank; we can sit in the comfort of our homes and apply for loans, buy insurance, transfer money online and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are already interacting with chatbots, digital assistants and getting our day-to-day banking done online and finances related queries sorted efficiently. With the new dimensions of AI being infused in the BFSI sector, we will soon see it achieve a greater level of capabilities while simultaneously making banking processes less time consuming and simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a Digital Banking Report, \u003ca href=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/58063/personalization-in-banking-digital-research-study/\"\u003eThe Power of Personalization in Banking\u003c/a\u003e, it was found that consumers want to share their personal information if they can receive custom advice, offers and service based on this shared insight. Personalized communications and advice as enabled by AI can be reflected by online advisors – that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the help of a human counterpart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI that enhances the customer experience significantly will be the primary use case for financial organizations to up their use of technology in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePutting human talent to better use\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the primary reasons why financial institutions are adopting AI in a big way is because it is helping them improve customer experiences. AI can take seemingly routine and repetitive processes and make them efficient and effective, without human effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: what used to be a very tedious process of new customer onboarding, communication can now become highly personalized interactions, based on individual activity after opening an account. This level of personalization was almost impossible to achieve in the past without the benefits of machine learning and AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile machine learning is making banking systems more intelligent  \u0026#8211; identifying patterns and connections that humans can\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8211; most machines will not replace a bank’s staff or personnel. Human interactions will be required for consumers who have more complex queries and requirements. In fact, bank employees view chatbots as a great help that allow employees to focus on closing more complex tasks and conversations, while bots perform the generic tasks faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, the key for financial institutions would be to use technology and human talent in a calculated way. While AI can complete compliance requirements, customer informational documentation, routine tasks and even product ‘frequently asked question’ responses – bank employees will have more time for strategic tasks that require empathy and intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe rise of new-age Fin-tech players\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFin-tech, of late is riding a huge growth wave using AI.

Many players in the space have seized the opportunity and are growing at an exponential rate. The reason these players have witnessed tremendous success is because via their offerings, they are making an effort to simplify financial processes for consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: mobile wallets have become hugely popular as they have made day-to-day transactions much easier for people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent \u003ca href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/indian-m-wallet-market-expected-to-be-rs-1512-bn-by-fy22-4448353/\"\u003eASSOCHAM report\u003c/a\u003e says that the mobile-wallet market in India is expected to grow at over 190% to reach Rs 1,512 billion by financial year 2022 from the current level of about Rs.1.5 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis clearly outlines the fact that people are willing to adopt new technologies that makes their finance related procedures hassle free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banking and financial services sector in India needs to embrace technological advancements like AI to plan for a rapidly changing future.

This activity demands to understand a JD and a resume at a higher, deeper level. This requires a lot of messy wanderings through unstructured text, extracting important skills and traits from each section, and coming up with a similarity score between a resume and JD. It could sometimes become very difficult as it is hard to teach a machine how to extract important information from unstructured text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady for a fun fact?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the animals that evolved in our planet, somehow, we are the only species able to create a syntactic and semantic complex-rule based language for our communication!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rich set of vocabulary, contextual information and syntax makes it tough for a machine to parse important information. Yet, we are getting very good at understanding JDs and resumes using a set of new tools in our arsenal, which includes Deep Learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Deep Learning?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning, based on modern neural networks has been able to surpass human level inaccuracies in various domains. It is fascinating to us because it can efficiently encode a lot of contextual information, which helps us to understand the important features automatically. Previous machine learning models required us to do a lot of manual feature engineering but with Deep Learning that has changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning can automatically infer most of the features, and even beat those shallow learning approaches in many cases if tuned properly with enough data. For example: a trained sequential model could differentiate between \u0026#8216;working with project manager\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;working as project manager\u0026#8217;. A one-hot encoded vector could be easily fooled in thinking that both of the sentences are almost similar, but a Deep Learning based recurrent neural network can use the contextual information in making a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePredicting the relevant title\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatural language has a lot of variations like the one we have mentioned in the earlier example. Although a naive algorithm would be able to extract important skills from a job description and a resume, it could make a lot of silly mistakes. What if we can reduce a job description and a resume to a birds-eye-view and look at it in a different perspective altogether?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also work directly with client specific problems, one of such important problems is to hire good external candidates from job portals like Naukri, Monster and Shine. Sometimes, it becomes tough to identify the candidate title as they can be very specific to a client. For example, client could internally call a role as \u0026#8216;Desktop Engineer Band 2\u0026#8217;, but the actual role is for a \u0026#8216;Desktop Support Engineer\u0026#8217;. When searching for candidates externally, it would be better to use titles like desktop engineer or desktop support engineer. Using alternative titles in querying for candidates would improve the relevancy of the search results. Here is one such job description. If we can predict these alternative titles, it could be used as a way to normalize titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6104\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?resize=686%2C359\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"686\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=1145\u0026amp;ssl=1 1145w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6106\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?resize=694%2C416\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=911\u0026amp;ssl=1 911w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe model\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been criticism about Deep Learning and it\u0026#8217;s black box nature.

This is not true in the real world. Each class might interact and be correlated with the other. A Deep Learning model uses shared parameters among all the classes, this generalizes better to unseen data than individual classifiers. Also, there has been research suggesting that deep learning can be very \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694\"\u003eresistant to noise in labels\u003c/a\u003e. And, Deep Learning models can scale well with data. As deep learning uses matrix multiplications, it can be efficiently implemented on a GPU. Moreover, they are not black boxes. You can interpret them as you would interpret a linear regression model, but it\u0026#8217;s just a little more difficult.

The dataset contains the data from various domains. In the data preparation stage, classes with very low number of occurrences were removed. The samples were tokenized into sentences and then sentences were tokenized into words. Each word is assigned an index with a random embedding that is learned during the training phase. The pre-processing was kept to a minimum except for word lowercasing. We have not identified any phrases beforehand. The model hyperparameters: word embedding size of 300, a word level Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with hidden state of size 200, a sentence level GRU with hidden state of size 200 and around 2600 classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt uses a uses a hierarchical structure that encodes the given unstructured text into a vector using a recurrent neural network inspired by this \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf\"\u003eresearch work\u003c/a\u003e. Each sentence is passed through a network called Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which tries to capture the important information in the sentence. These sentences (with their vectors) are clubbed together to form a sentence vector by using another GRU. By using this structure, we can reduce all the complexity in the unstructured text to a single vector which could be used to make a prediction about the title it belongs to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the weights are initialized randomly, and the whole network is optimized with negative log likelihood objective function with a softmax at the end to normalize the probabilities. The model was trained with SGD optimizer, the learning rate was chosen by closely monitoring validation loss on a small dataset. Gradient clipping was also used. The validation loss was monitored at the end of each epoch, and early stopping was used as a regularization technique to avoid overfitting. At the end of seventh epoch, the validation loss started increasing, so training was halted. The model reached around 24.5 top-1 accuracy before it stopped improving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is the training loss of the model plotted against minibatch number.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6109\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?resize=693%2C469\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"693\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=1030\u0026amp;ssl=1 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis was the first of the 2 part blog series on how Deep Learning can effectively help us decode JDs.

This is particularly significant in a nation like India which is one of the most youthful populaces on the planet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA current Gallup study including over 1 million respondents in the US discovered just 29% of millennials are locked in at work; the staying 71% are either not locked in, or are what Gallup calls, \u0026#8216;actively disengaged\u0026#8217;. Just half of them plan to be with their present organization one year from now. Gallup refers to this characterizing study as the \u0026#8220;most strong and exhaustive investigation of the millennial era.\u0026#8221;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese discoveries wouldn\u0026#8217;t be surprising to Indian HR experts, who manage numerous smartphones and snapchat-fixated millennials every day. The million-dollar question accordingly at the forefront of everybody\u0026#8217;s mind is: the thing that drives these millennials – what makes them tick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, here’s a look at how organizations can crack the code and keep the millennials in their workplace engaged and driven at work, and win their loyalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide freedom with responsibility: Millennials love their freedom as much as they love their smart devices. During work hours, this smartphone or tablet addiction may even hamper their productivity. To get them to focus on their work, our advice is to not restrict them – but to be liberal with your trust and creative freedom – and clear about deadlines and responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe creative in assigning responsibilities: Millennials love responsibility where they can show their leadership abilities. It’s a good thing to remember that they also love creative freedom and prize flexibility in their work schedules. So, make them take over office parties, the daily ‘coffee-quiz’ and the fun Fridays.   in addition to their work responsibilities. Not only will this excite them but they will also love the attention and importance they get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppreciate and encourage them: Millennials crave recognition; and managers should devote special attention to provide genuine feedback and appreciation. It works better when it is constructive. HR business partners can ask line managers to draft handwritten notes to thank their young colleagues for a job well done.  Sending recognition mails marking senior members of the team if they met a deadline for a crucial project could also go a long way in motivating millennials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStand up for work-life balance and flexibility: Most millennials are acutely conscious of having a life outside office and do not like to mess up with their work-life balance. For them performing well and being a high-achiever at work is as important as spending time with friends, often pursuing a hobby or simply partying. They are blurring the divide between professional and personal life without compromising on either. Organizations can be mindful of the change this generation is bringing along at the workplace and create flexible work time policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide a rich professional experience to them: Millennials can be impulsive when it comes to job-hopping, but they also love to stay in a role that adds value and learning to their CVs. If you wish to retain them, consider providing a rich professional experience to them. It could be about entrusting them with execution of an important project, offering timely feedback, rewards and recognitions, creatively incentivizing them, providing a mentor to nurture their skills and talents, or promoting them out-of-turn on merit and performance. Any or these approaches will enhance their professional experience and build loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillennials are an impetuous generation, with an inbuilt sense of entitlement and seeking quick gratification. However, they are also out of the box thinkers, very creative and talented; and can be extremely passionate about whatever they take up in life, and that includes a job in your organization. They live for themselves and want to make a difference. The workplace of the future must be open to bend a few rules and create a few new ones to keep the millennial motivated and engaged.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eLet us know what you think of this blog in the comment section below!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"ideas-engage-better-millennials-workplace","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eAs the rate of millennials making up the workforce consistently increases – we must understand what rouses them and how we can empower them to put forth more effort.

This approach helps the application not to pause or sleep, but to become available for other requests. Let’s explain this with an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSuppose the program will read a .txt file and print the content as output.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-5726\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nodeJS.png?resize=300%2C151\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"nodeJS\" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nodeJS.png?resize=300%2C151\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/nodeJS.png?w=571\u0026amp;ssl=1 571w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you notice the code, you will find in php, in line no#3, it will start reading the file and before finishing up reading the file it can’t do anything else. That means php blocks the execution there. Whereas in case of nodeJS, in line no#3 it starts reading the file and assigns a callback to it, and proceeds to the next line. It continues executing the other parts of the program and whenever the “fs” finished reading the myFile.txt, the callback will be called to process necessary statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFast processing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003enodeJS uses V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one that Google Chrome uses. nodeJS has a wrapper over this JavaScript engine providing some extra facilities to build network applications. Both the nodeJS wrapper and the V8 JavaScript engine are written using C language; which makes it really fast.

Because, from an advertiser’s point of view, if I can load the ads before all the contents of the page is loaded, I may catch the visitor. Another is if my ads load slower, the visitor might navigate to somewhere else. So ad servers really need to be fast and thus nodeJS should be used.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStock exchange software\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThings have to be very much real time in case of stock updates.

A current overview said that Indian representatives spend almost 33% of their time via web-based networking media amid work hours. Then, organizations would be concerned and need to realize what their folks are doing on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July last year, newspaper reports suggested that the Indian government planned to prevent its employees from posting social media posts critical of any government policy or action. The government is not alone, many private corporations also prescribe rules and guidelines for social media conduct for their employees. The fear of reputation damage is so high that some of them have become extremely vigilant of what their workforce is doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t even have to be existing employee for your social media usage to be tracked; an organization you have applied to for a job may also want to know more about you through your online behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following are a couple of basic territories that a current or would-be manager could track on your online networking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial networking profiles: Organizations with social media policies and guidelines will want to keep an eye on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles of their employees to see if the set rules are not being violated. Other organizations may simply do this to understand your work-life balance and to see if you are facing any work related issues that may find a vent online. In many cases, your colleagues are friends on your social profiles and they may flag any concern to the HR department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReligious, racial or political inclinations: Many individuals carry strong religious or political inclinations and do not hesitate to share extreme viewpoints. Such behavior could even cost them their jobs, as US Mayor Beverly Whaling recently learnt to her chagrin, after her unpleasant comment on the US First Lady Michelle Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft skills: Particularly relevant for prospective hires; hiring managers at would-be employers would want to observe how you express yourself, and how you deal with people online. Your online posts and comments could be grounds to make inferences as to whether you have the necessary soft skills, including networking and people management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetworking skills: A prospective employee’s online connections can be a powerful window for organizations to understand how well networked he or she could be. Most companies view a well-connected employee as an asset as there are chances that the employee could create and convert business opportunities from her online connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContributions to communities: Whether you are a programmer or a marketing or HR executive, your contribution to relevant online communities like StackExchange, Quora or CiteHR could also be tracked by existing as well as prospective employer to better gauge your skills, knowledge, and your ability to contribute as a team member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePer a recent media report, social media plays a crucial role in the hiring process today with over 94 percent recruiters using LinkedIn to recruit new candidates, while 79 percent of job seekers use social media to find new jobs. In fact, some advanced HR tools now offer social search; allowing prospective employers to discover ideal candidates through social media profiles. For employees and job seekers, the message is clear – what you do on social media may have a lasting impact on your career.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHope you liked this article.

It could be about entrusting them with execution of an important project, offering timely feedback, rewards and recognitions, creatively incentivizing them, providing a mentor to nurture their skills and talents, or promoting them out-of-turn on merit and performance. Any or all of these approaches will enhance their professional experience and build loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillennials are an impetuous generation, with an inbuilt sense of entitlement and seeking quick gratification.

Naturally then, organizations would be concerned and want to know what their people are doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July this year, newspaper reports suggested that the Indian government planned to prevent its employees from posting social media posts critical of any government policy or action. The government is not alone, many private corporations also prescribe rules and guidelines for social media conduct for their employees. The fear of reputation damage is so high that some of them have become extremely vigilant of what their workforce is doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t even have to be existing employee for your social media usage to be tracked; an organization you have applied to for a job may also want to know more about you through your online behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are a few critical areas that an existing or would-be employer could be tracking on your social media:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial networking profiles:\u003c/strong\u003e Organizations with social media policies and guidelines will want to keep an eye on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles of their employees to see if the set rules are not being violated. Other organizations may simply do this to understand your work-life balance and to see if you are facing any work related issues that may find a vent online. In many cases, your colleagues are friends on your social profiles and they may flag any concern to the HR department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReligious, racial or political inclinations:\u003c/strong\u003e Many individuals carry strong religious or political inclinations and do not hesitate to share extreme viewpoints. Such behavior could even cost them their jobs, as US Mayor Beverly Whaling recently learnt to her chagrin, after her unpleasant comment on the US First Lady Michelle Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoft skills: \u003c/strong\u003eParticularly relevant for prospective hires; hiring managers at would-be employers would want to observe how you express yourself, and how you deal with people online.

In fact, some advanced HR tools now offer social search; allowing prospective employers to discover ideal candidates through social media profiles.

table","content":"\u003cp\u003eHR leaders across the world want a seat at the strategy table. Sadly, they find they are not asked to sit down. Why?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo get a seat at the strategy table, HR first needs to be strategic!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis rallying cry of wanting to be “strategic,\u0026#8221; could mean one of two things: having a role and voice in business strategy and/ or being asked for HR input on business issues. But examined critically, those become outcomes; they have to be worked toward and earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, HR can earn a strategic role, but it means thinking in an entirely different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C-suite is eagerly looking at HR to prove its mettle and stake its claim at the executive table. After all, a company is only as good as its workforce, and HR is largely responsible with building that winning team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHR, more enabler than strategic influencer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at HR’s trajectory over the years, it’s easy to see how its importance has diminished steadily. In other words, its viewed more as an enabler – focused on operational tasks – and not a strategic partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile other functions have been demanding technology and automation to up their ante – HR is lagging far behind. 2015 saw $2.4 billion in VC funding for HR tech and new HR tech startups, but many companies still aren’t investing in this technology. But if HR departments shift their focus to become big-goal advisors, who contribute to a company’s strategy and direction, they can not only campaign for better technology platforms, but also earn that coveted seat at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eConsidering people data\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHR tech and analytics need to be focused on strategy, data, and analysis, with the KPIs focused of advancing the value of the company. Yet, let’s not forget that HR is all about people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese analytics could measure employees in terms of the value they add to the overall company strategy. HR needs to adopt a long term view of the situation and realize that instead of concentrating on hire rate, they should make sure they’re recruiting the right people who directly contribute to the company’s main goal and help them progress on the roadmap to success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, instead of endlessly debating employee retention percentages, the HR team should evaluate whether they’re keeping the people who truly matter to the company goals, and reorganizing the unnecessary roles or the underperforming employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDefining goals \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it isn’t HR’s responsibility alone to figure out what a company’s strategic objectives should be. Executives must play an active part in identifying the strategic objectives, and collaborate with HR to determine how the talent of an organization individually and collectively need to develop, work and be staffed in order to achieve organizational goals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSay for example, a company’s goal is to become number one in customer satisfaction — the actions and analytics of the HR team must directly be linked to the hiring, training, developing, motivating, retaining people with good customer skills. The company cannot provide the best experience to its customers without the right, qualified people in those key positions, with the right measurements to analyze and course correct if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThinking like a C-suite executive\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, HR needs to think strategically. In most organizations, HR is an overhead department, a cost centre. A business cannot get away with providing products and services that do not add value to the customer for very long.

Collaboration and participation work hand – in – hand to create communities that help organizations innovate and build interesting things. While open source continues to expand into diverse and different sectors, and has proven successful, the success of technology happens when an organization is successful. What makes an organization spearhead is the strength in its core of how decisions are made, executed, engagement with its staff, transparency, openness etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what does it take to become a good open organization? Good Management. It can make or break both financial and cultural success. An open organization culture, where there is no complete control over the ecosystem, can sometimes prove a little challenging for people coming in from proprietary companies because the whole model, processes, team management etc. are completely different. We at Red Hat, come across such situations quite often and our way to tackle this is by balancing the cultural equilibrium and competitive advantage with our extensive on-boarding that helps with self-regulation. For eg. The Red Hat Ambassador program – The premise is that no one can find a potential or future Redhatter better than a Redhatter himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

This also means to hire new, fresh talent who can predict the roadmap and at the same time, look at their current employee fleet who may have unrecognized talent. Next-generation workers are keen to work at organizations with flattened hierarchical structures that provide greater exposure to senior leadership and encourage thinking ‘outside the box’. Next generation ways of ideation and working is epitomized by environments where the younger worker is both the mentee and the mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere at Red Hat, we follow a strategized development process where there are teams and individuals who will be assigned for guidance, mentorship and find the hidden talent one has. This allows transparent collaboration through every stage by making the process conversational and open to anyone and everyone who is interested. For eg: if a developer is passionate about contributing to open source cloud projects, we make sure that he/she is put into at least one challenging project thus enabling their passion to shine in their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.

The technology is gaining its popularity as companies realize the benefits of the flexible service and application delivery platform. Containers simplify he life for developers and operational staff. Container based architecture does not follow the typical traditional huge architecture and need not manage, pack, upgrade, migrate, replicate all the time. It makes life simpler to manage immutable deployments of microservices-based architectures. The awareness of the technology and benefits thereon has been steadily growing, and continuous efforts in enhancing its usability and capabilities are very much in progress. However, this might take a little while still for enterprises to fully accept and implement it in their systems and processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.

They have a targeted and well-communicated talent strategy to best align their workforce with forthcoming organizational plans. Hence, HR operating model for these companies is designed to reinforce that strategy. However, what differentiates an agile organization design with that of a reactive one is in their intent and ability to adopt technology to enable this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have often seen clients grappling with the challenge of understanding tactical and strategic workforce framework definitions. It is extremely critical to understand workforce planning entails before embracing technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a simple explanation. Workforce planning, at tactical level, is about rostering, daily task scheduling and monitoring, shift planning based on forecasted volumes or client billing, and utilization. A significant portion of this rests with command center and delivery functions within an organization with off-the-shelf systems providing best-in-class monitoring technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkforce planning has evolved to include budgeting and forecasting where again project management offices in most companies play a critical role defining resource requirements and ensuring increased utilization and billing.  While organizations with sustained business lines need minor changes to workforce plans due to well-established operating models, new growth businesses seek the ability to scale up and down on workforce requirements based on market conditions. Realizing the potential of data integration, many companies have designed a technology backbone that enables resource requisitions based on CRM data. However, owing to lack of accurate, robust data this model fails to generate the seamlessness that is required. Approval workflows and real time data are critical in achieving the desired transactional success metrics. This would certainly result in the desired business outcome \u0026#8211; a robust plan on headcount, revenue per FTE, talent cost as percentage of overall project / organization costs and profitability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the above plan is perfect, often times, organizations fail at executing it right as execution is a cascading phenomenon across organization hierarchy. The span of control and layers of company design plays critical role in determining success or failure of a well-defined charter. And that brings us to the next level of talent supply chain that adds a strategic spin to design consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRM’s and effectiveness COE within HR are often challenged by business to build a design and operating model that befits the budget. Understanding business requirements and linking talent management (skills, attrition forecasting, critical resources \u0026amp; roles, underdogs vs. underperformers) becomes the defining factor in this marriage. Historically, HR resorted to excel sheets to map resource skills and criticality, which was based on inputs from Project managers. They would then aggregate and normalize these. This analysis helped them make a strategic contribution to the most important asset of the business – workforce. What could really enhance their contribution is Technology. Tools that enable HR to view current vs. budget headcount, integrated sales pipeline views and integrated talent supply chain scorecards presenting a skills layer, performance layer and role fitment recommendation, will largely be essential to allow RM’s to play a truly strategic role in Workforce Management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal economy is no more at the cusp of change but it’s safe to say that change is constant. Forces of startups and new age technology drive changes faster than anticipated. Companies are moving away from yearly to six monthly and quarterly guidance clearly showing impact of macro factors on business stability. The critical role of analytics and predictive insights to chart strategies and execute them flawlessly is undoubted.  Analytics is no more a separate function but an integral element to a unified workforce planning charter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo cope with this fast paced business environment, workforce planning and talent management need to work hand-in-hand. Companies that ‘smart engage and fast engage’ their workforce based on skills and competency will enjoy significant bottom-line advantage as against companies that are reactive in their approach to workforce planning. This also necessitates a change in discipline of sales managers to comply with pipeline updates. And therefore further presses the need to redesign sales incentive plans: moving from revenue coverage and buffered margin to incorporating actual achieved profitability over contract values as part of the compensation structure. Bringing about this change in the workforce planning approach will equip companies to meet and exceed guidance values. While automation is one lever, the second important lever is people allocation effectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo conclude: A powerful technology platform that enables delivery of an integrated workforce and talent roadmap is imperative to business success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4822 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?resize=170%2C171\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"1\" width=\"170\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?w=204\u0026amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?resize=150%2C150\u0026amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eAuthor – Dilshad Kothawala\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDilshad is the head of Product Strategy at EdGE Networks, an HR Tech startup, which aims to solve workforce related challenges in organizations using Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

We have many people with education degrees and certificates, but their suitability to a job is quite limited. Lot of skill needs to be imparted to them before they become employable. No wonder many companies run University/College style class rooms within their organisations before they absorb them in their jobs. Definitely there is awareness and progress on the skill front. The National Skill India initiative and a dedicated Ministry for this purpose is very welcome and heartening. More fundamentally we need to strengthen our grass root education system in schools and colleges and impart them real education rather than the Rote model or the exam percentage measurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you think NASSCOM’s Skilling India initiative help boost the employment market?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is definitely of use, but not sufficient for a country as large as ours. If we look at the spread and touch points for many initiatives, it is quite limited in scale. It is daunting. My belief is that we have to do more systemic changes in the school, college and exam models for us to bring about substantive change. There are also other skill areas which are not necessarily education oriented but vocational in nature. We need a large pool of them as well, if we want to sustain our development agenda. We need carpenters, plumbers, masons, mechanics, electricians and the list goes on. There is severe shortage on that front. Nation will not run if we have only software engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe proliferation of digital technologies is changing the business landscape. How do you see this impacting an organizations skills mix? How should leaders gear up to ride this wave?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital transformation is happening all around us and is unstoppable. Everyone needs to learn to deal with everything being Digital! The newer generation is quite comfortable with the Digital scene but the earlier generations in an organisation are finding it difficult to adapt. But I am happy, the way India, particularly the rural populace has embraced Digital technologies, thanks largely to the Mobile phenomena. For leaders they have to deal with a different eco-system today. Meetings are virtual, attendance to office is optional, work from home is a large part of the design, 24\u0026#215;7 work ethic is a reality, constant connectivity and round-the-clock operations put pressure on personal time and such issues. Best is to learn to adapt than resist the change. From a personal experience, I can vouch that it is going to be fun and more productive being Digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of the hiring related challenges that you have faced and how did you overcome them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiring is a constant challenge. We as leaders are invested with our emotions in hiring and from an employee standpoint, it is about the balance between emotion and opportunity. Best people are attracted to companies with great people, great culture and with an opportunity to do something substantial which can add value to their career. People usually do not change or join jobs for compensation, while it is definitely a hygiene issue. It is difficult, but important to treat employees as you would treat yourself or expect to be treated by others. Long term relationships with employees brings stability, commitment, growth and a highly productive environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Anil Valluri\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4671 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=177%2C210\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Anil Valluri\" width=\"177\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=253%2C300\u0026amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=768%2C911\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=863%2C1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnil Valluri\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e is the President of India \u0026amp; SAARC Operations for NetApp. He joined NetApp in February 2012.

Data storage- it refers to the different ways in which data can be stored- in hard drives, RAM storage or the cloud.\u003cbr /\u003e\n3.

It also makes employee data easily accessible by storing it at a central place. Since HR teams usually work with very sensitive pieces of employee data, data management also plays the crucial role of keeping data safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBusiness Intelligence\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it is\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe simplest way to explain business intelligence would be making the effective use of data and information to make well informed, sound and viable business decisions.

However, in reality, it could have been external economic factors, personal family reasons or other reasons that may have influenced his/ her decision. The candidate could be a perfect fit for the current role.

Zoom out and you will see that it’s not just technology that is getting consumerized but lifestyle, in general – HR cannot escape being bitten by this bug!

Corporate training is one such area. With the proliferation of open-online courses, there is a course or two for every subject that one could think of. There are specialized courses with customizations and are easy to access anytime, anywhere. To top it all, they are not too heavy on the pocket as well. With the business environment changing rapidly, mainly owing to advancements in technology, employees need to keep themselves up-to-date to further their professional development.

There has been increased focus on innovation and entrepreneurship in the recent years – VC funding is booming!

However, most organizations are either using analytics on an ad hoc basis or apprehensive about moving away from intuitive people decision making.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is due to a combination of lack of data culture in the organization and also the historical reputation that HR is not about data. On the contrary, HR could gain immensely from data analytics as they are privy to a large amount of data. It helps them forecast future needs so that the organization has a robust talent pipeline and engaged set of people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGartner defines some key areas that HR and HR IT leaders must consider: Do your recruitment practices ensure sufficient diversity in the workplace? Do you truly believe that you are recruiting the best people for the job? Do you believe you are getting value for money from your learning management system (LMS)? Is there adequate regular use of your LMS by your employees? Are your employees truly developing their skills and expertise?

After all, he was a cognitive scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis remarkable contribution doesn’t end with AI alone, he developed the Lisp programming language family. He invented the ‘garbage collection’ method to solve problems in Lisp. A garbage collector attempts to reclaim garbage (unusable material). Similarly, this method finds data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future and reclaims the resources used by those objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also significantly influenced the design of the ALGOL programming language which became a very influential programming language by introducing many new constructs now in common use.

I could see genuinely happy people, excited to meet me as I was being introduced to everyone by Bachal, the Lead HR. They didn’t need to invest that minute or two in getting to know me, but yet they made the effort to get to know who I was and where I was from. I was really touched.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the days passed, I realized how none of the corporate stereotypes applied to our company. I never encountered any sense of elevated ego that comes with one’s position, no assumptions on the basis of your experience. I could walk into any function to present my suggestions up front and they would be willing to listen. In fact, Arjun, the CEO of our company, takes vital time off his schedule to walk around the office and interact with everyone regularly.

What works well for us is helping the business ask questions they may not have asked before.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChevron’s analytics group\u0026nbsp;functions like internal consultants, Milnor said. “It’s providing the strategic questions back to the business for them to consider and providing them new options to achieve their business objectives. And that has worked extraordinarily well.” It helps to bring the HR data analytics team into the conversation at a senior level, he added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes using HR data analytics effectively requires trial and error, Milnor said, recounting a time his group set out to analyze a learning and development program to understand its impact on Chevron, running multiple regression analyses\u0026nbsp;on the effect on attrition and productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There weren’t any [effects], which kind of surprised us,” he said. The problem was Chevron had taken a data-mining approach — throwing a lot of data and seeing what came out — instead of a hypothesis-driven one employing root-cause analysis or some test of the hypothesis.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“We put our engagement data in there, and we saw a nice relationship between engagement and safety measures, which we didn’t know existed before,” Milnor said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKelly stressed the importance of understanding that predictive analytics\u0026nbsp;can’t be precise, which CFOs know well from their financial forecasts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There has to be a mind shift to be able to walk in and feel comfortable with a dialogue,” Kelly said. “It’s not always about the math. It’s about the story the business is looking for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There’s really not a science to move from reporting to predictive to optimization,” he continued. “It’s more of a process and a dialogue and a comfort level with being incorrect with some numbers and going back and re-optimizing the models.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3\u003eChoosing software, managing data\u0026nbsp;\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eKelly outlined several options for approaching \u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAI in human resources\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e data analytics. “There is enough packaged software that exists within your [human resource information systems] to handle the reporting. When you start to move into predictive, there are [a] several ways that you can look to approach this.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirst, decide what types of statistical tests to apply to each situation, and whether to use hypothesis- or data-driven approaches. Build a team and bring in resources from finance, strategic planning or HR: It will be tougher to scale and not always efficient, but more learning is possible. Hiring a consultant is another route, but the methods will be harder to repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe panel consensus was that data doesn’t have to be perfectly clean, and what analysts need instead is knowledge of how much accuracy is required for each problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never worked in an area where the data is perfect,” said Elpida Ormanidou, vice president of global people analytics at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the retailer based in Bentonville, Ark. “A really good analytics person will be able to assess what is good enough. … You can make a lot better decisions from good enough data than no data at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKelly said never to start with data cleanup because it’s a never-ending process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s better to decide first how much the data inconsistency influences the model and tell senior managers why it’s worth cleaning up the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalytics will always involve probability-based models, according to Kelly. “You’ll never get to the point where a software vendor will be able to say, ‘Here is the future, and therefore you should plan for this.'” Instead, “futurists” can propose what-ifs\u0026nbsp;and ranges of likely outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day, it always goes back to the business person saying, ‘I believe this is the most likely path forward, and we’ll plan for this, and we’ll calibrate along the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGetedge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e uses advanced tools\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eto ensure the data analytics is more accurate and sensitive to business requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSource:\u0026nbsp;http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/news/4500258389/HR-data-analytics-demands-sensitivity-to-business-needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"hr-data-analytics-demands-sensitivity-to-business-needs","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003ePanelists from Chevron, Morgan Stanley and Wal-Mart explained how to build productive relationships between HR analytics teams and the business side.

And though job postings for web designers have fallen 8 percent, the skill of web design has risen by 11 percent in marketing and 9 percent in graphic design.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“Based on the data we analyzed, 2016 looks to be the year of the hybrid job – and the hybrid employee,” Larson said. “The successful employee of tomorrow will need to combine traditional soft skills such as communication and collaboration with the hard, technical skills that used to belong to a select tech-savvy group.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome skills are more marketable than others.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe top three skills needed across the nine job categories were business development, knowledge of Oracle – a database management system, and mathematics, but knowing multiple coding languages like SQL and SAP, and having experience with data analysis were also extremely valuable, Burning Glass found.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving these skills on your resume can make a significant difference to your starting salary, Larson added. “Anyone with data and analytics experience is going to skew higher salary-wise [than their counterparts,]” she said. “Those with social media experience will skew higher but a little less. Same with sales.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to build your skillset in college, Larson recommended you look for a school that offers interdisciplinary majors.

He became fascinated with how small adjustments in ways managers interact with their workforces could change financial outcomes. “It’s very much like changing a financial portfolio: We change the portfolio of our people,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, Milnor launched a team at Chevron to deliver key performance indicators (KPIs) and tools requested by HR, such as headcounts, attrition rates and dashboards. The team has since more than doubled in size and shifted its orientation from basic reporting and KPIs toward business questions faced by executives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat led to creation of a workforce analytics center of excellence (CoE) consisting largely of project managers and analysts — generalists who gather data and build dashboards. Nowadays, the 15-person CoE maintains a “workstream” on workforce planning and advanced analytics staffed by specialists in attrition, hiring and employee surveys. “The very narrow focus allows them to knock out reports when they need to, and also have the bandwidth to be able to explore deep into that terrain,” Milnor said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CoE is not part of HR. “We have conversations with HR all the time, but we’re actually a separate business unit,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElpida Ormanidou, vice president of global people analytics at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the giant retailer based in Bentonville, Ark., said she moved into HR in 2008 after working in customer operations.

There’s a need for those two, but many times the question is simply, What?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn workforce planning, the what could be simply headcount, attrition rate or traditional financials. But true optimization tries to answer more difficult questions, such as which skills are undergoing a transition or that can help replace skills gaps that arise from employee movements and are usually addressed by hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrmanidou said her take on the reporting, analytics and optimization breakdown is that business managers tend to want reports: “If you let them, they will drown in an ocean of reports and they will keep asking for more,” said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, when David Scott became Wal-Mart’s head of HR, he wanted the exact count of the roughly half million out of the 2.2 million workers who leave every year.

Especially for businesses in dire need of a competitive edge, it\u0026#8217;shard to overstate the excitement and possibilities that such a wealth of information offers. That being said, big data is only as useful as it is properly wielded, and the question of how to wield it isn\u0026#8217;t always easily answered. If your business has already embraced the promise of big data, here are seven ways you can still use it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Better Reports\u003cbr /\u003e\nBig data is supposed to mean better data, but if you and your employees can\u0026#8217;t organize it and ingest it in a way that yields greater efficiency and a more robust bottom line, what use is it? One key to using big data better is to make sure that what\u0026#8217;s collected can be properly disseminated, and the generation of better reports can do that for you. With reporting software from companies like Windward, you can embed document and report generation into whatever big data harvesting software you\u0026#8217;re using so you and your team can see what\u0026#8217;s being gathered and what it means more clearly and more quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Better Insight\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnother way in which your company can probably use big data better is in the achievement of better insight. The insight you need from big data depends in large part on the type of work you do. Understanding your customer base better in order to more effectively target them for direct mail campaigns is only useful if you use direct mail. Big data has to be tailored and fine tuned in each instance of its use, or the insight it promises you may not be as applicable as it could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Better Customer Experience\u003cbr /\u003e\nGone are the days when customers wanted good customer service; now, they want that and a host of other pro-customer experiences. Let big data help you craft a better customer experience by ensuring that every time someone interacts with your brand, you not only know about it, but you can understand the positives and the negatives of each interaction well enough to more effectively manage them. Customer experience is about the lifetime of a person\u0026#8217;s experience with a brand or business. Let big data help you know about and craft each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Better Speed\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt isn\u0026#8217;t enough to move faster than your competitors if your movement isn\u0026#8217;t in the right direction. With big data, it can be tempting to let every little insight equal a quick jump onto every bandwagon, but doing so is missing the point. Let the speed at which you can now make decisions be more about wisdom than about quickness. Because you can now know more than you ever have in a shorter amount of time, let that truth yield decision-making that is of the highest quality. Better-utilized and applied speed — not more of it — is key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?ssl=1\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1547\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?resize=300%2C240\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image 1_1\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" data-wp-pid=\"1547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?resize=300%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?w=733\u0026amp;ssl=1 733w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n5. Better Integration\u003cbr /\u003e\nIs IT still a separate department or idea at your business? It\u0026#8217;s time for those walls to come down. Technology is no longer it\u0026#8217;s own, separate offering that assists business here and there. Like it or not, technology is synonymous with the language in which business happens, and the faster you integrate that reality into the framework of how your company functions, the better. Don\u0026#8217;t let big data be something your IT department tackles and sends memos about. From marketing and HR to sales and supply chain, big data needs to be fully integrated into everything you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Better Accuracy\u003cbr /\u003e\nTrying to improve accuracy is a misguided quest that largely misses what big data can offer you. Accuracy is more about asking the right questions of big data than it is about ensuring that the data you\u0026#8217;re getting is right. Improve your accuracy by knowing more specifically what you\u0026#8217;re after. Too many businesses assume big data knows what they need. It doesn\u0026#8217;t. You do. Ask the right questions, and you\u0026#8217;ll get better and more accurate answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Better Nuance\u003cbr /\u003e\nNuance is where big data can truly shine. In the past, executives prided themselves on their people skills and intuition as guides that gave them a competitive advantage, and while intuition and the ability to \u0026#8220;read\u0026#8221; others are invaluable skills in life and business, big data isn\u0026#8217;t empathetic. Data-driven at its core and in its application, the nuance offered by big data can be hard to trust, because it\u0026#8217;s still so far outside the realm of most business people\u0026#8217;s experience. Don\u0026#8217;t balk. Let the nuance that\u0026#8217;s presented exist as nuance, and treat it as the finely honed, data-driven knowledge it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn business, the question is no longer: Should I use big data? The question is how. Follow these seven suggestions, and use big data in a better way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: http://www.smartdatacollective.com/tiffanyrowe/347847/7-ways-your-business-can-use-big-data-better\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"7-ways-your-business-can-use-big-data-better","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eBig data offers insight that can, at times, seem almost god-like in its breadth, depth, and application.
