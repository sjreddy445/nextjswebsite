{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":362,"title":"Happy Teachers’ Day","content":"<p>Teachers’ Day- a special day to appreciate and honour the contribution of our teachers and mentors, not only in our educational institutions, but also in our community and society, at large.<br />\nThe date on which Teachers’ Day is celebrated varies from country to country. In India, we celebrate Teachers’ Day on the birth date (5 September, 1988) of the second President of India, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan, a well-known academic philosopher.<br />\nTeachers’ Day is celebrated in all educational institutions, with activities of celebration and thanksgiving, in appreciation of teachers. All of us, who have children, can see them involved in making little drawings, cards or gifts for their teachers. It is wonderful to see this kind of appreciation for the people who help shape our children in to well-rounded human beings, who will contribute to our society.<br />\nIn this context, I think each and everyone of us needs to remember that learning and education does not stop in the classroom. It is part and parcel of our life. All of us are continuously learning from each other and our environment. We may be educated and trained in a particular field or have certain specialized skills, but if the interest or aptitude is there to learn something new, anything is possible.<br />\nEdGE Networks wishes each and every one of you, a very Happy Teachers’ Day, because we believe learning, teaching, skilling and mentoring is not limited to the classroom, but is an integral part of our lives. We believe that everybody should love what he or she does, so that our world is a better place.</p>\n","slug":"happy-teachers-day","subTitle":"<p>Teachers’ Day- a special day to appreciate and honour the contribution of our teachers and mentors, not only in our educational institutions, but also in our community and society, at large.
