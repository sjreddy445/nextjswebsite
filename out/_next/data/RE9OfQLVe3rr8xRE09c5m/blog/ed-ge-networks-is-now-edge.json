We are and will always be dedicated to simplifying talent decisions helping companies and individuals spot opportunities and create possibilities by offering intelligent decision-making capabilities.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Simplifying decisions is in our DNA. We do it through our products built using our smart AI technology – The EDGE Graph<i>TM</i> - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles. Our product taglines capture this essence and further fortifies our commitment to our customers.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">EDGE now has a fresh, youthful, and confident new look, with bold and defining colours.

The changes have been taken with a vision to better communicate the breadth of expertise that EDGE truly represents and realign with our vision and value proposition.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We’ve long believed that organizations tend to get nonchalant doing the mundane, just making incremental changes.

And this move is a proactive approach in that direction.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Thank you for your continuous support.
