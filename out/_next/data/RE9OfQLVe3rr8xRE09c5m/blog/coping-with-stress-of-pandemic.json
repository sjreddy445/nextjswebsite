{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":526,"title":"Coping with Stress Of Pandemic - A Session By NASSCOM Product Connect","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Part 1</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;Good evening, everyone. I'm Dr Apoorva Joshi, and I welcome you all to the special session on coping with the stress of the pandemic. And today, I'm pleased to be joined by Dr Jyothirmayi MD &amp; Arjun Pratap. Jyothirmayi is a psychiatrist, and she's an export counsellor. And Arjun Pratap is the founder of a very celebrated startup, EDGE, and he manages a team of young professionals. So welcome both of you. And thank you for finding precious time to join us today.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, India is currently facing probably the worst pandemic crisis in the world. And as we all know, every citizen has been deeply impacted. As days go by, we are experiencing more and more fatigue. So, coming straight to the point, Arjun, I would like to learn from you as to how the pandemic has impacted the industry and the employees? And what is your experience been like?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:&nbsp;</strong></i>So, my experience has been around, typically, my startup and my team and my colleagues and peers. And it's quite heartfelt, primarily, because the kind of empathy we required to make sure things are sorted must be with the velocity, with a deepness of understanding because we really started caring for each other in a deeper sense and in a more effective manner. So, when I look at my company, and we did a dipstick on the number of people who had COVID, who are sort of struggling to get tests done, some to get oximeters, some to get CT scans or different medication. It is important to connect the dots for them. So, you have to have channels open. And that's just the context of our company. And what I see is also the empathy movement, for instance, from our investors who come back and say, you know, we have a couple of companies in our portfolio, we are not aware of who also will help on oxygen, or will also help on getting your bed. So why don't you reach out this way? It's very heartening to see them pitching and delivers the message of connecting us to really help and empathizing with our situation. So, I think it is, it is important to recognize what's happening in the industry - companies are stepping up and saying, listen, we will, you know, take care of your vaccines, testing requirements; work from home, don't come to the office, because we are on a lockdown as well. But I think these are interesting times where the people element of the companies are starting to become a lot more real.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;Absolutely, absolutely. Thank you for shedding light on that. And so, how was the year 2020? And what is the difference that you see in the previous year? And in this current year? What are some of the challenges that you are seeing?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:&nbsp;</strong></i>It's a good question because the year 2020-21, in terms of the lockdown phase, is around the same sort of time period. But what we faced in 2020 was this whole view of annihilation and everything falling down. We were all panicking because a lot of things were breaking, a lot of businesses around was crumbling, and there was a lot of job and financial insecurity that was of big concern. So we went through different measures, like terminating our lease, cutting back on hiring and thinking about revisiting the structure of pay scales. Otherwise, how would we manage cash flows? How would we live another day? I think the sense was really April, May, June last year was about how to live, right? This year, if I had to reflect upon it, as a country, a lot more clear about managing it, and then we sort of lost the plot for various reasons. And I think the loss of the plot and coming back to the same state is fatigue. I think we're a lot better placed to deal with it because we have seen it in the past, but what we're dealing with is at a different scale. And that, I think, is the element of challenge that we have, because near and dear ones, every household, every family is dealing with it.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;Right. Thank you for sharing that. And yes, so every person has been impacted by the severity, and a lot of people have lost the near and dear ones. So Dr Jyoti, what are some of the major challenges that you were seeing in your clinical experience or diseases that people are suffering through because of this current pandemic crisis?&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>DR. Jyothirmayi MD:&nbsp;</strong></i>See, the world is currently facing a major crisis. But at the same time, when we see the opposite end of the spectrum, we see people who are trying to help in their own way. They are giving their 100% effort in facing the situation and are putting themselves at risk. However, we see rising anxiety in people. 1 out of 10 is coming up with the anxiety symptoms related to COVID or post COVID. This ratio changes to 1 by 5 when we consider the worldwide scenario. So, mental health concerns are increasing by two folds. We wouldn't be humans without our fears. So, whenever there is a fear causing stimuli, the brain simulation centre of our brain called 'amygdala' is stimulated, and our body gets ready for a fight or flight response. However, in the current scenario, the stimulation modes are constantly ringing alarm bells in the body because of the constant overflow of news or negative information. So, the body feels constantly under threat. And it is seen in some physical symptoms of anxiety or<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i>palpitations where the heart beats fast, breathlessness, dry mouth, sweating or coldness of hands or the urge to go to motion. Additionally, people are anticipating and catastrophizing COVID thinking that they or their family members might contract the disease, assuming worst-case scenarios.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And then there are depressive symptoms people are experiencing like sleeplessness, low appetite, PTSD, nightmares etc. Thus, a lot of mental health issues have suddenly cropped up; star employees have suddenly become poor performers, So, it's necessary to address these issues, put everything aside, strive to hold hands and walk together.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;I'm glad you raised the point that you know, we are seeing both ends of the spectrum that we have one stratum of people who are going out of their way to help out as much as they can and doing their bit even in service of strangers. And on the other hand, we are seeing survivor's guilt. So, these are two very extreme spectrums. And it's a very unfortunate time that we're are going through this at the moment. So, Arjun, from you, I would like to learn that what were some of the mechanisms that earlier, the employees would be able to do and unburden themselves. But now, it doesn't seem to work for them. So, she pointed out that some of the higher-performing employees might show a drop-down in their performance levels. So what are some of those differences that you've seen?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;In terms of performance and measures of outcomes, I think the idea is to just keep things going, make sure that you continue to interact with a certain level of normalcy, to ensure that other people also don't feel this overwhelming sense of abnormality. Where, where everything is going shit, you don't want that to happen as well, right? I think it's important to try and maintain that sense of control and direction for the people that you're economically taking care of; you need to understand their compulsions of working as well. And certainly not take advantage of it but be there from an empathetic standpoint and manage them through the process. So part of the thing that we did last time was actually engaging them through gamification because all of us were in this digital medium where we were connecting as a way of life, and then that way of life became very, very effective because we could conduct meetings faster, perform better, but what we do not realize that were relegated to so much screen time, which causes fatigue at the backend. So how do you manage that fatigue through mental days off? So I've read a recent article that one of our Product Marketing team and one of my colleagues also brought up from the HR side saying, we should be evaluating this and just, you know, between yesterday and today, we went through a whole thread of what all can we do yoga classes, meditation etc.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Leaders within the organization who have the responsibility and accountability to lead their functions and teams have to step up to the plate. And they're also going through their own trial and tribulations. Just because they have a leadership role to play doesn't make them superhuman. So this balance is very important. And it can only come if it's a two-way street. We are finally starting to understand that culturally we are a very empathetic society based on our development status.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;Very, very well put, Arjun. So like, as I shared that digital served as a medium for people to get an outlet. That was one, and you know, how the company was able to provide counselling, psychological counselling for its employees in the previous year as well. So, Dr Jyoti in you, I would like to learn that what are your key recommendations that, you know, employees and firms and organizations can do in such an extreme crisis? Like, what is your particular recommendations?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD:</strong></i>&nbsp;Let's say till yesterday we had something called Maslow's hierarchy of needs. So, till yesterday everyone was aiming at the higher level of needs. What usually happens is when the basic needs are fulfilled, then only a human being is loved or can think about the higher needs. In the current scenario, the basic needs are unfulfilled, and thus productivity/ creativity/ innovation is low. So here, we need to give that person some space, some time for people who are affected. This is where the organization's role is important.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">I have seen many big firms organizing employee programs like one-on-one talk with the employees or paying full salaries to those who get affected, And that is giving a boost for them- improving productivity, relieving stress and anxiety. So, I think that is what is happening when the basic needs are fulfilled, then only we can think about the higher needs.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Usually, human beings have what we call defence mechanisms. So the most common immature defence mechanism that we resort to is displacement. Some people go into denial mode, especially in this COVID; they try to, you know, put aside everything thinks everything is normal, there's nothing much serious, nothing is going to happen and all that. So, the number of preventive measures and all that they take will be less. So, let us not go into denial mode; let us accept that this is the situation and all of us at some of the other quality of time is going to face this. In the employee-company setup, if one particular individual is not able to perform the work properly, maybe others who haven't been affected by COVID can take up that extra work or try to help each other in some way. And the founders and the higher authorities can just sit up with the employees and, on a weekly, you know, call basis, try to encourage them to try to address their issues. I think communication is the key here because maybe we'll have the intent to help them, but it has to be also communicated properly so that they understand the key; these are the resources that are helpful resources available to us.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>&nbsp;Great, ma'am, thank you. So from both of you, I could gather that paying attention to the individual's changed behaviour, and listening, and empathy certainly helps, and then taking action, according to that. So thank you for sharing those key pointers on defence mechanisms that you've just listed.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Part 2 to be uploaded soon.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">See the video here:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"media\"><oembed url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8DoEfYDBj0\"></oembed></figure>","slug":"coping-with-stress-of-pandemic","subTitle":"Arjun Pratap, CEO, EDGE, Dr Apoorva Joshi, Digital Health Consultant & Sr. Associate at NASSCOM, and Renowned Psychiatrist, Dr Jyothirmayi MD, on how IT companies, especially start-ups, are coping with the stress of the pandemic\n","sizeInGrid":null,"meta_description":null,"metaDesc":null,"published_at":"2021-05-21T12:12:20.368Z","created_at":"2021-05-21T12:11:50.745Z","updated_at":"2021-11-05T09:59:56.585Z","featuredImage":{"id":521,"name":"Coping-with-stress-of-Pandemic.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1880,"height":1253,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Coping-with-stress-of-Pandemic.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":7.29,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_Coping-with-stress-of-Pandemic.jpg","hash":"large_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":666,"size":77.75,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Coping-with-stress-of-Pandemic.jpg","hash":"medium_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":48.6,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_Coping-with-stress-of-Pandemic.jpg","hash":"small_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":26.55,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9.jpg"}},"hash":"Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":206.59,"url":"/uploads/Coping_with_stress_of_Pandemic_a267e585c9.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-05-21T12:08:25.099Z","updated_at":"2021-05-21T12:08:25.169Z"},"categories":[{"id":1,"Name":"Industry News","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.560Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:13.950Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.593Z"},{"id":2,"Name":"Expert Speak","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.494Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:32.816Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.527Z"}]},"setting":{"id":1,"onScroll":false,"timeBound":true,"seconds":"15","userLeaving":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T05:20:57.164Z","created_at":"2021-09-06T05:18:56.571Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T05:51:58.729Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
