Asynchronous event driven IO helps concurrent request handling.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">1. nodeJS doesn’t provide scalability. One CPU is not going to be enough; the platform provides no ability to scale out to take advantage of the multiple cores commonly present in today’s server-class hardware.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">2. Uses JavaScript, which is easy to learn.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">2. Dealing with relational database is a pain if you are using nodeJS.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">3. Share the same piece of code with both server and client side.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">3. Every time using a callback end up with tons of nested callbacks.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">4. NPM, the Node Packaged Modules has already become huge, and still growing.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">4. Without diving in depth of JavaScript if someone starts nodeJS, he may face conceptual problem.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">5. Active and vibrant community, with lots of code shared via github, etc.</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">5. nodeJS is not suited for CPU-intensive tasks. It is suited for I/O stuff only (like web servers).</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\">\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">6. You can stream big files.</p>\n</td>\n<td style=\"text-align: left;\" width=\"284\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hope you benefited from this blog.
