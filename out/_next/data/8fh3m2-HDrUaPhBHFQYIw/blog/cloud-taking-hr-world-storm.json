And, this is true of all functions within organizations including HR. In a world where HR is termed as a strategic function that is critical to business growth, HR leaders need to be agile enough to respond to business requirements at the required pace.</p><p>HR Leaders empower themselves with tools and technology like cloud computing &amp; <a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/recruit\"><strong>AI workforce agility tool</strong></a><strong> </strong>that promote agility. Here we are focusing on cloud computing as one such technology that HR leaders are espousing to bring about the transformation that is required. On the back of the success of cloud computing in other business areas, HR is moving its on-premise systems to the cloud at a feverish pace.&nbsp; The reasons for the same are many:</p><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> The Slashdot effect is a thing of the past – thanks to the auto-scaling option that cloud computing provides. Its ability to scale on demand is the best advantage of cloud computing. This helps HR organizations in fast and easy scaling.</p><p><strong>Low cost of ownership:</strong> With the pay as you use model, SaaS offered on the cloud provides better ROI. Its ability to scale up and down as required provides significant cost saves thereby making it more affordable.</p><p><strong>Innovation:</strong> As cloud based HR software allows for easy changes and upgrades, innovation in HR processes is made easy. It fosters experimentation, eases development and speeds deployment.</p><p><strong>Mobility:</strong> We are in an era where information is required on our finger tips at all times. This is enabled by mobility at the enterprise level. Moving to cloud helps staff access corporate systems on their mobile device anywhere, any time.</p><p><strong>Self-service:</strong> The intuitive user experience offered by the cloud makes moving to employee self-service that much more easily. This frees up HR time to focus on more strategic activities.</p><p>While there are many benefits of moving to the cloud, there are some critical considerations that businesses must not ignore in order to make a success out of cloud implementation.</p><p>The most popular deterrent for cloud adoption is security – data loss and privacy are key challenges that HR organizations must cater to before jumping on the bandwagon.</p><p>Change management is key to the success of cloud adoption with mindset shift being a major challenge. This is enhanced by the fact that customization is hard in cloud software which means processes need to adopt to the new system.</p><p>This makes preparedness for transformation very important. However, this can be overcome by robust planning and strategizing prior to cloud deployment.</p><p>Last but not the least, businesses should be aware of the roadmap the vendor has chalked out so that they are aware of impending changes and upgrades and are better prepared to handle them.</p><p><i>Leave </i><a href=\"https://getedge.ai/\"><i><strong>Edge Networks</strong></i></a><i> a comment and share your thoughts.
