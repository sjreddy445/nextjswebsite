The workers were shocked to find out that their pay checks weren&#8217;t credited on time, leaving them high and dry on the busiest shopping day of the season: Black Friday.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">What happened? A key individual in charge of the organisation’s payroll had gone off to enjoy the lengthy Christmas break and forgot to approve the company’s electronic transfer of funds.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">And with due cause, the Human Resource Team inbox was flooded with emails from disgruntled employees displaying their blatant displeasure with the company and how they had to bear the burden of overdraft charges levied on them due to insufficient funds in their accounts.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The solution was relatively simple. Companies shouldn’t be relying solely on manual transfers for crediting salaries and commissions, as the employee’s basic comforts get denied.
