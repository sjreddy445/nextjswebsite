Think again? &nbsp;In the world enabled by technology, nothing is impossible!</i></p><p>Letâ€™s bring you back to today -The world of MOOCs has been taking over â€“ Coursera, EDX, Udacity have crossed Millions of users online and the counters are running! Truly, turning the power, over to you dear learners.</p><p><strong>2015 and beyond, the world of digital shall only make this more fascinating â€“ &nbsp;the intelligence of analytics, social, cloud, mobility, all coming together.</strong></p><p>The question is- whatâ€™s in it for L&amp;D professionals who work away their hours to ensure corporate learners get the best of learning programs! &nbsp;Before we get to how L&amp;D professionals need to change, letâ€™s center our discussion on the Learner of tomorrow. &nbsp;In short he/she would be one who:</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â–  &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Seek answers anywhere, anytime, just in time.</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â–  &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Stay connected and hooked on!</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â–  &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Shall be a provider and a receiver</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â–  &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Shall want content to discover him/her , rather than search</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; â–  &nbsp;&nbsp;</i>Shall seek learning from experiencing</p><p><strong>Incredibly different from a workforce which waits for organizational sponsored programs isnâ€™t it?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;With a tectonic shift in a learnerâ€™s mindset, whatâ€™s in it for learning departments of tomorrow?&nbsp; Would they exist in the shape and form? Would they need to acquire new skills and what would they be? &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Synthesizers and&nbsp;Synergistic</strong>: While learning has evolved immensely from spray and pray approaches, the future is&nbsp;<strong>Learner led</strong>&nbsp;â€“ the answers will come by to learners, however you need L&amp;D professionals to synthesize and channelize discussions. This also means that business leaders, experts, the social media junkie from grad school are all L&amp;D professionals â€“ you canâ€™t base a learning organization on a team which drives learning.&nbsp;&nbsp; It needs an organizational workforce to make it a learning organization.</p><p><strong>Connecting the Dots</strong>: â€œWhat can you learn from the Beatles? How about leadership lessons connecting art and innovation? How about we visit the intensive care unit of a hospital to help our learners experience the need for skill and speed?&nbsp;<strong>From being â€˜programâ€™ driven, corporate learning would move to being immersive.&nbsp; </strong>The need for L&amp;D professionals to have diverse interests, stay connected to sources of learning ranging from history to art to cultures, and contextualize to the industry and business outcomes is key â€“ &nbsp;The skin in the game is when L&amp;D folks can connect the dots to discern whatâ€™s important.</p><p><strong>Creative with data: Itâ€™s a DIY World</strong>&nbsp;â€“ I donâ€™t need an L&amp;D person to match make a mentor / coach for me, when that person can find me! &nbsp;&nbsp;All I need to do is get endorsed for a skill / capability, define my budget and voila â€“ I pop up as someone seeks me.</p><p>And what if that happens even before an event occurs / even before my customer approaches me with a problem? L&amp;D shall comprise teams of business savvy statisticians and anthropologists who look at data differently, more creatively, organize and study learner patterns or&nbsp;where is the learner&nbsp;spending time most? What drives them crazy at work and help them with relevant content?</p><p><strong>And yes, you would need your Thought Leaders to set direction for learning and ensure itâ€™s tied to business strategy.&nbsp;Now the next time you ask about ROI, I may have a suggested answered for you ðŸ™‚&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I am sure many have started their journey in this direction, it would be fun to see what the future has in store!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vidya.jpg?resize=200%2C200&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Vidya\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vidya.jpg?w=200&amp;ssl=1 200w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Vidya.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"200\"></figure><p><strong>Vidya Santhanam</strong> is Program Director, Organization Development at Mindtree.
