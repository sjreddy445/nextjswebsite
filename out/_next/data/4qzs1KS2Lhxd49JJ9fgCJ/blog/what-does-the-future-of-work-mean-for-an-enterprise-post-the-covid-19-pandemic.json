Enterprises rolled back on hiring, and SMEs/SMBs shut workplaces till further notice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Since it was first declared a global calamity&nbsp;by the World Health Organisation (WHO) in late February 2019, a market survey report has&nbsp;showed&nbsp;that over 65% of companies shut down, pending an economic revival. Also, <a href=\"https://www.shrm.org/hr-today/trends-and-forecasting/research-and-surveys/documents/shrm%20cv19%20research%20presentation%20release%202.pdf\">more than 60%</a> of&nbsp;all&nbsp;the organisations in&nbsp;the world either froze their hiring channels or deferred joining dates for the future.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even&nbsp;though&nbsp;only&nbsp;about 4 – 7% of companies have laid&nbsp;off a portion of their workforce, the United States has&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that&nbsp;over&nbsp;22 million individuals filed for unemployment benefits since the beginning of the pandemic.&nbsp; Though things are looking better the road to recovery is still foggy.</p><p>The WorldWorld has changed forever. The last time the economy took such a brutal beating was in 2008. However,&nbsp;analysts predict that the economic backlash caused by COVID-19 will be far more significant.&nbsp;For the first time in history, the value of a single barrel of&nbsp;crude&nbsp;oil dipped below the USD 1 mark.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, as the saying goes, ‘This too shall pass. Just like how the crude oil market self-corrected its value overnight, so will the global economy. Once the&nbsp;potency&nbsp;of the virus declines and vaccines begin to hit the market,&nbsp;organisations and enterprises will need to swing back into action.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But we must remember that with such a trenching impact on the economy, jobs and working conditions will never be the same again.&nbsp;Skills will evolve, redundant roles will get axed, and the automation of repetitive tasks will&nbsp;forge the way forward.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This doesn’t translate into a loss of jobs but more of an evolution.&nbsp;So, how will organisations cope with the gradual shift in working conditions and requirements so as to efficiently hire for the Future of Work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Planning&nbsp;and Forecasting</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Enterprises will need to start arriving at the idea of Talent&nbsp;Decisioning&nbsp;with a more holistic approach.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>HR leaders will need to be more aware of the market and understand how businesses, projects and goals have changed. By understanding how a client’s business requirements have changed, the talent pipeline will also have to be&nbsp;modified to source the right individual for a job.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Evaluating skills required, skills present&nbsp;within the organisation, project requirements, client goals etc., will become much more critical whilst seeking new talent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Career Sites</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>An important yet often ignored facet of HR Technology is the requirement for robust career sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;A dedicated career site helps an organisation by tackling two&nbsp;defenders at the same time!&nbsp;</p><p>The platform serves as&nbsp;an internal repository of information pertaining to the workforce’s skills, experience&nbsp;and&nbsp;overall performance metrics.&nbsp;A robust career site ensures employees regularly update the platform with the necessary skills.&nbsp;And with an added layer of intelligence, the platform can deduce skill gaps and make relevant up-skilling/re-skilling&nbsp;to ensure employees start imbibing skills for the incoming requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The second facet of the&nbsp;Career Site is that&nbsp;it&nbsp;helps in <a href=\"https://edgenetworks.in/\">Workforce Optimization</a>. Hiring managers can access relevant profiles with just a few clicks, thereby fulfilling open positions internally. It reduces the overall cost to hire (C2H) and helps in employee career progression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is essential to know that adequate career progression reduces overall employee attrition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Enhance Recruitment with Technology</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Technology in the field of recruitment has existed for years, but it has to go beyond&nbsp;the&nbsp;rudimentary&nbsp;ATS (Application Tracking System).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Sifting through hundreds of resumes, shortlisting and marking them to the&nbsp;Talent Acquisition&nbsp;team has always been tedious, resulting in hours&nbsp;of&nbsp;workforce wasted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>HR Technology was born when HR applications began adding a layer of intelligence with the help of AI and Machine Learning (ML). Now,&nbsp;with AI, the tool or application&nbsp;can scan through dozens of resumes in a second and stack rank them&nbsp;according&nbsp;to relevance. This&nbsp;reduces&nbsp;the time invested, thereby reducing the overall hiring cycle duration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The Talent Acquisition pipeline is becoming increasingly intelligent with the help of technology. Organisations that adapt quickly and utilise technology&nbsp;will&nbsp;solve future talent-related shortages,&nbsp;which in turn will positively impact their business.</p>","slug":"what-does-the-future-of-work-mean-for-an-enterprise-post-the-covid-19-pandemic","subTitle":"The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) brought businesses and operations to a grinding halt all across the globe.
