We certainly do. But have we thought about what makes him or her so smart and resourceful in their thoughts and actions?</p>\n<p>Organizations too love such employees who habitually provide  solutions on the table rather than those who keep whining about all that’s broken. Being resourceful is a wonderful quality to have on and off the workplace, although it is rare.</p>\n<p>Hear this wonderful TED talk by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rahimsajan/\">Rahim Sajan</a> , a teacher, curator and entrepreneur.

Alarmed by the nonsensical ideas of Transactional Analysis, Patrick Vermeren, in his TED talk sets out on a mission to reveal the truth about the many HR theories, models and questionnaires. The academic literature revealed that most HR practices in recruitment, assessment and development are very problematic and some even dangerous. Let’s hear the alternatives which he puts forward in this interesting talk.</p>\n<p>Patrick Vermeren has been active as a consultant, trainer and coach since 1996. He built on his experience at major Belgian banks (Cera and Dexia) and an American multinational ( Procter &amp; Gamble).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0C5UQbWzwg8\">The (uncomfortable) truth of HR and leadership development | Patrick Vermeren | TEDxKMA</a></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone  wp-image-6909\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.jpg?resize=680%2C383&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.jpg?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.jpg?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.jpg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/4.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Regina Hartley, an accomplished HR professional with strategic and tactical experience in human capital management across multiple business units thinks that those who don&#8217;t always look good on paper may be just the person you need to hire.
