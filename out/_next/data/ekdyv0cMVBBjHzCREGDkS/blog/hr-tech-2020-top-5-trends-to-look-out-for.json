As the market beg</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ins</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> flooding with new players and competitive rivals, organisations across the globe will start looking at solutions with higher efficiency and increased productivity gains.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">So, here are the top 5 trends in the field of HR Technology to look out for!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">1) </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Era of Self-Service Technologies</b> </span><br />\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of the biggest introductions into the employee experience was the acquisition of both Employee Self-Service (ESS) and Manager Self-Service (MSS) tools, in order to make HR related information more easily accessible. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, studies and surveys have shown that despite the initial excitement surrounding ESS and MSS tools, organisations have begun to roll-back on the product altogether. A Sierra-Cedar HR Systems survey report, for the year 2019-2020, showed that even though companies are still purchasing ESS and MSS tools, they aren’t being fully utilised</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">A detailed study revealed that a persistent problem was the mounting pressure on Managers, to fulfil HR related activities. By inculcating MSS tools, the organisation had inadvertently placed a massive burden on Managers to deliver on these tasks, which further p</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">laced</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> the HR department in a bad light. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Hence, the company’s hand was forced to retract these tools and switch to open and shared-service platform</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">s</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, where HR administrators could assist the Managers. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">One of the most promising iterations of ESS and MSS tools would be to gauge Learning and Development (L&amp;D). </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Learning and Development is provided to employees in a menu card format, with dozens of learning opportunities and career choices. This has either confused the </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">employees or</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> left them feeling overwhelmed.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Organisations will need to investigate the specifics, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> recommend the right learning options to ensure an employee can achieve their most desirable career-path. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">2) </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Expanding horizons for AI deployment</b> </span><br />\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">The words Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have become household names over the last 5 years. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI-embedded HR products have passed real-world tests and will continue to be a governing backbone for diverse functions in the HR space. However, analysts are trying to comprehend the pace at which HR Tech adoption will progress. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">HR professionals a</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ll over </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">have said that in the next 2-5 years, more than 50% of organisations all over will be using AI-based HR Tech products for at least one critical function. This could either </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">be </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">for L&amp;D, business insights, workforce insights </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">or</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> recruiting. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Yet, some individuals feel the adoption timeline is severely optimistic, like that of HR Cloud Services, which took over ten years to attain its current level of mass adoption. This is primarily due to the lack of ethical standards and functional regulations around AI implementation. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">majority of</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> the industry believes that AI adoption will only spike, especially in the field of Talent Management and Talent Acquisition. As the world is facing a talent shortage, AI will become instrumental </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">in</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> sourc</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ing</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> the right talent. Also, organisations will need to </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">study</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> employee behaviour and comfort to prevent attrition. Time management for recruitment will also become a core functional benefit of AI. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">As opposed to screening thousands of resumes, whilst battling employee churn rates, to find the right talent, AI will start looking at employees who are most likely to stay and recruit them accordingly.  </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">3) </span><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><b>Workforce of the future</b> </span><br />\n<span data-contrast=\"auto\">Every single HR professional is currently onboard the ‘Workforce of the Future’ agenda, without realising the primary pain-point.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Establishing a healthy working culture for employees will fall flat on its face, unless coupled with the ability of the workforce to upskill / reskill themselves </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">in order </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to meet incoming business demands. The technology wave has grabbed the global industry by storm, and countless technical graduates haven’t equipped themselves with the right </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">set of </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">skills and education. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">AI enabled HR technologies can be deployed to gain a cumulative view of all the available skills in an organisation, predict incoming business demands and deduce the shortage of key skill sets needed to tackle evolving enterprise needs</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

It provided a systematic check-and-balance, where an employee’s performance for an entire year was evaluated before awarding suitable compensations, appraisals and rewards. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">With the influx of the Gen-Z and Millennial crown, the single day appraisal system has lost its sheen and viability. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">More than 83% of new hires quit their jobs within the first 6 months, citing either deplorable working conditions, opaque communication channels or higher salaries. These employees belong to the ‘New Age Working Order’ and hence refuse to conform to age old practices. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">CPM, powered by AI-ML algorithms, help the managing personnel to collate data from diverse sources and extract the most relevant data from it.
