Yes, JavaScript without a browser. nodeJS itself is not made in JavaScript completely, rather it&#8217;s wrappers are made in C. It just executes JavaScript.</p>\n<p><strong>What nodeJS is NOT</strong><br />\n■    nodeJS is not a framework, it’s a server<br />\n■    nodeJS wrappers are written in C and not in JavaScript which works on top of V8 engine<br />\n■    It’s not multi-threaded; It runs in a single thread with callback concept</p>\n<p><strong>What nodeJS is</strong><br />\n■    It is a server which can interpret JavaScript.<br />\n■    It is a open source and cross platform to make real time network applications.<br />\n■    It provides you asynchronous, event driven I/O APIs.<br />\n■    It runs single threaded event based loops, so all executions become non-blocking.</p>\n<p><strong>Architecture</strong></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-5602 aligncenter\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Node-JS.png?resize=439%2C375&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Node JS\" width=\"439\" height=\"375\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Node-JS.png?resize=300%2C256&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Node-JS.png?w=541&amp;ssl=1 541w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 439px) 100vw, 439px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>nodeJS has several layers in its architecture written in JavaScript and C/C++.</p>\n<p>First layer has all standard libraries written in JavaScript which generally interacts to our application. Then we have several node bindings(libUv) then after inner layers.</p>\n<p>LibUv is an abstraction layer on the top of libeio , libev, c-ares ( for DNS ) and iocp (for windows asyncronous-io). LibUv performs, maintains and manages all the io and events in the event pool. ( in case of libeio thread-pool ).</p>\n<p>Crypto helps to implement cryptography to perform encryption and decryption on root level.</p>\n<p>DNS helps us on resolving domains on root level.</p>\n<p>Libev is the event loop which actually runs internally in node.js to perform simple event loop operations. It&#8217;s written originally for *nix systems. Libev provides a simple yet optimized event loop for the process to run on.</p>\n<p>LibEio is a library to perform input output asynchronously. It handles file descriptors, data handlers, sockets etc.</p>\n<p>V8 Engine help us to execute JavaScript logics and converting them to machine code.</p>\n<p><em>This was the first of the 3 part series on nodeJS.
