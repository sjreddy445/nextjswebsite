Having a significant skill gap can negatively impact a business. It can stunt and stop growth as the workforce doesn’t have the skills to drive the business forward. There are multiple reasons as to why a skills gap could arise, from an aging workforce and a hike in automation to an increase in highly skilled jobs that employees can keep up with. But, its not the end of the world.</p>\n<p>What follows is a 5-step guide, to how HR can identify and minimize the skills gap in a business.</p>\n<p><strong>1.Skill testing and benchmarking. </strong><br />\nWhen aiming to tackle this problem the first aspect to look at is where your employees stand, this way you will have a clear starting point. Skill testing and benchmarking is the best way to do so, as then you will be able to see what it is that the business requires and can move forward from that.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/uf0EYGcobAity\" width=\"480\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>2.Create a development plan.</strong><br />\nOnce you know where your employees are at you can start to create a development plan. It could incorporate various forms of training such as seminars, online tutorials, etc. and how you would go about bridging the gap between your workforce and the needs of the business. You could also set benchmarks to see how your employees are doing, if your plan is working and whether you need to make any changes.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xT0GqFLmrEKeeLOYsE\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>3.Reward and recognize accomplishments.</strong></p>\n<p>Rewarding and recognizing accomplishments gives your employees something to work towards and helps boost their motivation. Study your workforce and create incentives that would motivate and interest them.  A motivated workforce is a productive one. This process helps drive their professional development, adding value to your employees themselves and in turn your business.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/D6Fs9bewUXQmQ\" width=\"480\" height=\"199\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>4.Identify additional gaps.</strong></p>\n<p>Skill test and benchmark again, repeating this process might be annoying but after all the development and time spent on your employees, identifying any additional gaps is important. Otherwise over time it could manifest and result in another major skills gap that could put a hole in your progress.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xTiTnGeUsWOEwsGoG4\" width=\"480\" height=\"270\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>5.Make sure you have the right environment.</strong></p>\n<p>To retain your top talent and employees in general, you would need to be able to offer certain perks as that can make or break whether those employees will stay with you or leave you for another business that makes them a more attractive offer. This not only allows you to retain your employees but can lead to an increase in job satisfaction.</p>\n<p><iframe class=\"giphy-embed\" src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/11BbGyhVmk4iLS\" width=\"480\" height=\"365\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></p>\n<p><em>If you like our article and would like to share your views, please drop your comments below.</em></p>\n","slug":"5-step-guide-combat-skills-gap","subTitle":"<p>A skill gap is the difference between what a company needs and what its workforce can do.
