We all know by now that analytics can help HR drive change, boost workforce engagement and enable strategic decision making. In fact, HR functions have been talking about all this for some time now but appear to be stuck in neutral.</p>\n<p>Functions such as Marketing and Finance have evolved and understood how to leverage data well. HR too needs to look outwards at how it can use people data and analytics to help the business grow and solve problems.</p>\n<p><em>Mixing it up</em></p>\n<p>The modern HR organization today is in need of people who can understand the business, who get HR and can do data. But the sad truth is that many HR teams do not currently possess all the skills required to meet this challenge.</p>\n<p>HR must change the mix of its function as well as its priorities. This might involve looking beyond traditional talent pools when staffing the HR team. While hiring for HR business partners, consider ex-consultants, people who can present business cases cross-functionally and with a lot of data.</p>\n<p>Another activity on HR’s to-do list must be upskilling in people analytics skills.

HR analytics reporting must be integrated into the business strategy: it needs to have a good narrative, and to be targeted and transparent.</p>\n<p>HR has many strengths and one of them is good storytelling. HR just needs to apply these storytelling skills to data and make the magic happen across organizations!</p>\n","slug":"big-reveal-hr","subTitle":"<p>HR is often the organization’s favourite punching bag when it comes to providing hard numbers.
