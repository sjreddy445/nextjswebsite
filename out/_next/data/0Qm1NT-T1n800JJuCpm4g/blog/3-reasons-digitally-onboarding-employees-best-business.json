On boarding is very important as it plays a crucial role in shaping the attitudes of new hires. Whether we like it or not almost everything now is being digitized and taken online. So, here are the three reasons why the process of digitally onboarding employees can work as an advantage to your business.</p>\n<p><strong>1.Saves time</strong></p>\n<p>When onboarding manually the process can take up to three to four days to complete. However, if done digitally it could be completed even before your new hire begins work. Filling out paper work and completing formalities can take a while, so why not have it done in advance. Before an employee arrives, a business can set up a lot of things online, such as training which, if done when they start work would take up time that could be used more effectively. Businesses can also set up online mentors and make the company handbook and other resources such as podcasts and blogs available digitally so that employees can get an understanding of the business environment and what would be expected of them. All of this not only saves time but makes their transition into the company smooth and allows them to start work on what is important as soon as possible.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xUPGcq6cAnpcLz0lZm\" width=\"480\" height=\"268\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>2.Saves money</strong></p>\n<p>Not only will the process of digitally onboarding save you time, but money too. Considering how long the onboarding process can be, financing these processes could cost a lot. Financing the training of new employees, as well as the cost of assigning a mentor and having new hires adjust and adapt to their new work environment can work out to be cost ineffective and negatively impact the productivity of your business. By making these processes digital your business can save resources and allocate funds more effectively.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/xTiTnqUxyWbsAXq7Ju\" width=\"400\" height=\"480\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p><strong>3.Increases productivity</strong></p>\n<p>By changing your businesses onboarding process from manual to digital, you not only save time and money, but you will see a hike in the businesses productivity too. Onboarding manually creates lot of unnecessary time and money consuming processes that can be avoided. By onboarding your businesses digitally, you will have more control over what goes on as it enables such processes to be streamlined. You will also be able to create more personalized onboarding experiences for different kinds of employees that will help in aligning new hires with the goals of your business. This way they will also be familiar with everything once they start work, eliminating wastage of resources.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/kBhgPVLVQzpXa\" width=\"480\" height=\"441\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p>There are multiple onboarding software’s that your business can use to customize and streamline your onboarding process. Either that or your business can create its own custom onboarding portal. Having portals where in which new hires can upload documents, references, etc. and fill out mandatory forms can be very effective. As not only will everything be in one place but will be easily accessible to everyone. To give new hires an insight into the workings of your company, you can create and upload videos for them to watch. Rather than having all new hires come in for orientation which can be very lengthy and isn’t likely to be effective. Keeping with the times, another option would be to create a virtual reality experience which would allow your new employees to truly get a feel of what the business environment is like. Businesses need to remember that the onboarding experience is crucial and will impact the way employees perform.</p>\n<p><iframe src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/3otPoEvMyH2X0NTOWk\" width=\"480\" height=\"198\" frameBorder=\"0\" class=\"giphy-embed\" allowFullScreen></iframe></p>\n<p>If you like our article and would like to share your views, please drop your comments bel<em>ow.</em><br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-7348\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Azara-1.jpg?resize=136%2C175&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"136\" height=\"175\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt; color: black;\"><strong>Azarah Singh</strong> is currently an intern at EdGE </span><span style=\"font-size: 12.0pt;\">N<span style=\"color: black;\">etworks and will be going on to study business management and entrepreneurship. </span></span></p>\n","slug":"3-reasons-digitally-onboarding-employees-best-business","subTitle":"<p>The process of onboarding involves integrating a new employee into a business by helping them familiarize themselves with the day to day operations of a business, its clients as well as the products and services it offers.
