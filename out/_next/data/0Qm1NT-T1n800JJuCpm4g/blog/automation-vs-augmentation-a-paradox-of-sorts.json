Can they work together in conduce? This is the perennial perplexity faced by organizations, especially the talent acquisition teams that aim to make hiring simpler but accurate.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Though talent acquisition professionals worldwide have been reaping the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) benefits or the last few years, they rarely understand the difference between the two. There are numerous misconceptions regarding their application and benefits that form a constant barrier to its implementation and usage.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">According to a report from Entelo, more than 70 per cent of the HR workforce believes that automated sourcing would improve their productivity levels. Furthermore, the research conducted by Oracle and Future Workplace revealed that 50 per cent of HR heads already utilize some form of AI at work, a massive increase from 2018, where it stood at 32 per cent.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A buoyant recruitment model requires successfully implementing both technologies at heterogeneous touchpoints for informed decision making – from screening applications to sending emails, scheduling meetings to compare different candidates.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">While on the one hand, automation takes over mundane tasks like screening resumes, scheduling emails and calls, as well as other manual chores, augmentation takes on complex roles of intelligent information gathering and analytics, on the other. Thus, low priority but tedious regular jobs are automated, giving precedence to professionals to focus on mid and high-level tasks.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The hiring begins with automated processes and provides more intelligent solutions with augmented capabilities; it supports talent managers with unbiased, non-judgmental and astute hiring solutions. An ideal hiring process with the right mix of automated and augmentative AI should be something like this - automotive AI scans through thousands of resumes, and augmentative AI assesses each profile for its novel experiences and distinctive traits that make it unique; to provide talent professionals with the candidates who best fit the job profile. After that, automated AI takes over the regular tasks of scheduling a call/ meeting with the candidate, sending them updated meeting requests giving the recruiter scope to face-to-face interviews and assessing the candidates‘ skills compared to their resumes. An intelligent talent management solution also accords the recruiter to recomb the large pool of unhired candidates who may have gone through the interview process smoothly but were never hired. This pool provides top-notch candidates who may not have the requisite experience but can immensely contribute to organizational growth.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Augmentative AI can also help talent managers compare the skillsets of recruits to other successful hires in the past, creating a powerhouse of data and hidden gems that can be mined as and when required, instead of relying only on new resumes every time a new position opens up. This can be clearly understood in times of the pandemic – with the pressure to increase performance and downsize the workforce, organizations all across are facing a tough challenge. They could hire the best talent across industry lines and categories but ensure they could deliver. Thus, the barriers of location, geography, timelines have disappeared and what has remained is diversity and inclusion. Today, a person sitting across the globe could be recruited to fulfil a particular position handling complex jobs, which could otherwise only have been performed by aspirants from a specific sector or city. However, this can only be successful if organizations provide the right tools that enhance collaborative work. According to KPMG, almost 70 per cent of business leaders are working towards building on their use of collaboration and communication tools, and 67 per cent of them are more likely to invest in technology.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Capgemini believes new technologies will challenge the HR organization by making parts of the traditional operating model obsolete. According to their report, over 35 per cent of the conventional HR workforce will face massive changes over the next 10 years to augmentation.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Hence, automation and augmentative intelligence must work in tight synergy to achieve fruitful results. We need to understand that AI is not an all-encompassing solution; preferably, its benefits permeate various levels of the acquisition process, sometimes in nooks and corners we may not even tend to realize.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The better understanding of automation vs augmentation, the more productive and cost-effective the talent management team is, and the better opportunities it has to implement industry-leading AI systems and processes.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p>","slug":"automation-vs-augmentation-a-paradox-of-sorts","subTitle":"How talent acquisition benefits from both?
