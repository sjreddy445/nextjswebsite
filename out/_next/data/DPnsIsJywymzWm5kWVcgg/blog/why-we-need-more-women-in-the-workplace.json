{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":561,"title":"Why We Need More Women in The Workplace?","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">“<i>It’s the fire in my eyes, and the flash of my teeth, the swing in my waist, and the joy in my feet. I am a woman phenomenally.</i>” – Maya Angelou.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A woman alone has power; collectively, they have an impact. Today, women are reaching every place in the professional world, but there are instances of the gender gap. World Economic Forum (WEF) says it will not take less than 136 years to close this gender gap.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">However, a lot is being done to bridge this gap. There have been calls for greater gender equality in recent decades while enhancing the need to close the gender wage gap. Although tremendous strides have been made in this aspect, there is still a fundamental lack of women in mid-level managerial to leadership roles in the workplace.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It is time organizations create better policies and opportunities for women. At the same time, women also need support to step forward and overcome the habits holding them back.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">With this, let’s dive into the world of women in the workplace, outlining the top 5 reasons gender inequality should be kicked out of the window.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>1. Women transform teams and workplaces</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The strength of a woman can be tested in a crisis. And organizations can learn mountains from this. When in the face of a problematic situation, the woman leader will be calm, poised and rational.&nbsp;Organizations can be assured that their decisions will have multiple positive implications.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>2. Women are bold decision-makers</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Women are known to make bold and wise decisions as leaders. This helps make the team environment less authoritative and more cooperative, bringing a family-like feel. This boosts teamwork and helps implement a new culture within the business.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>3. Increased Innovation</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">According to Accenture, if companies want to grow, they also have to innovate. Diverse workplaces bring diverse thoughts, enhanced creativity and ideas to the table. A bias-free, empowering and gender-equal workplace leads to innovation. The workforce in such organizations is willing to step the curve and experiment with new ideas.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>4. Diverse thoughts, better outcomes</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This will, in turn, create more sustainability and growth within an organization. It increases productivity, improves performance and boosts collaboration. Such workplaces are likely to experience better ROIs. A McKinsey&nbsp;report shows that increased gender diversity should improve profitability by 21%.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>5. Ability to multi-task</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Women are multi-taskers. They can wear many hats simultaneously – employee, mother, sister, boss, daughter etc., and perform all tasks expected from them with finesse. This inborn trait helps them adapt to new situations quickly and focus on navigating solutions to real-life problems.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Thus, it’s time to move beyond the heroes and give the she-roes an equal chance.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p>","slug":"why-we-need-more-women-in-the-workplace","subTitle":"It is time organizations create better policies and opportunities for women.
