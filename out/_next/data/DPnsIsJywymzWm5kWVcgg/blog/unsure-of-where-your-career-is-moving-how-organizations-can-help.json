{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":546,"title":"Unsure Of Where Your Career Is Moving? How Organizations Can Help.","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Sometimes, it is easy for organizations to lose great employees if too few opportunities are available for their upliftment and growth. Most times, the employee himself is unsure where his career is chartered towards. They think the organization has no growth and tend to leave, not understanding that the vicious circle begins as soon as he joins his next stint. According to LinkedIn's workforce report, 93% of employees are willing to continue in their present organization if the latter invests in their career development.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">In both circumstances, the organization stands to lose the most since it can cost businesses more than the amount lost on the employee's salary, both recruitment and diminished productivity combined. The Employee Retention Report by the Work Institute reported that 1 in 4 employees would leave their job. However, with proper Learning &amp; Development (L&amp;D) strategies, employers can prevent 77% of that turnover. Therefore, regardless of the exact dollar value, retaining employees is more cost-effective than the costs associated with separation, recruitment, and the hit to productivity.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">According to the same report, companies that spend at least $1,500 per employee annually report earning 24% more profit than those with smaller L&amp;D budgets. But how do organizations define what exactly do they need for the upliftment, skilling or growth of their employees? How do they determine what skills each employee needs to achieve their career aspirations? What can organizations do to charter the career graph of their employee in the right direction?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The fact is that it's challenging for anyone in the organization to understand what the employee wants. Why? Because the career aspirations will be different. The skilled landscape is evolving. And what do you keep up with? However competent a resource manager is, they can't keep up with skill sets that match what the employee or employer wants. That's where EDGE Pathfinder becomes an exciting product for the benefit of the employee and the organization.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Built on our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles, EDGE Pathfinder puts the employee in the centre and simplifies employee engagement.

There are a couple of stops on the way. So, the employee can systematically work on those steps to reach her next job profile faster.
