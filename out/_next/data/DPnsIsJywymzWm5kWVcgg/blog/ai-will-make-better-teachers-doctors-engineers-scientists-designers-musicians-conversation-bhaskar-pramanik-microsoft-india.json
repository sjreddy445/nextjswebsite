You’ve led companies that have ridden the wave of technology and done it well. Today, these companies face steep competition from startups in the recruitment market. How do you weather this competition in attracting the right talent?</strong></p>\n<p>At Microsoft we continue to consider ourselves as a 40 year old Start Up! We do not really have a challenge in attracting talent irrespective of the function – Engineering, Research, Legal, Marketing, Sales. Finance, Services, Technical. We are also one of the preferred employers by fresh graduates. Part of the reason is that we continue to innovate, are very diverse and inclusive, global in scale and have a very empowering culture – we call it the “Growth Mindset’, provide challenging opportunities to learn, experiment and grow. We also provide a great working environment, competitive compensation, great culture and values and are global in scale and opportunities. More important we give our employees the opportunity to continuously learn and actively participate in our growth and innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>2.You are an integral part of the evolution of technology, having been at the center of it all. You’ve led companies that have ridden the digitization wave and done it well. There is both excitement and anxiety about digitization in general and Artificial Intelligence in particular. We all understand the power of AI and the reason behind the excitement. What is your take on the anxiety part?</strong></p>\n<p>I have been part of the technology industry over the last 40 plus years and have seen how computing has become ubiquitous and invisible. We now take it for granted as it impacts our everyday life. And we have accepted it.</p>\n<p>As technology advances so does human capability. As Machines become more intelligent so do humans.</p>\n<p>So I am not worried about AI replacing jobs or taking over our lives.</p>\n<p>It will make our lives better, enabling us to focus on areas where we as humans can truly make a difference. AI will make better teachers, doctors, engineers, scientists, designers, musicians. We only use 20% of our brain capacity so with assistance from AI perhaps we can unlock the balance 80%.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Technology has enabled a new era of startups and entrepreneurs. While they are great for business and economic prosperity, research shows that only 10% of them succeed. How can entrepreneurs make sure that the odds are in their favor?</strong></p>\n<p>Technology has made time and distance  irrelevant. It has enabled global business models that would not be possible without technology.</p>\n<p>So a few suggestions for startups.</p>\n<p> \t&#9632; &nbsp;&nbsp;Be clear who is your customer and what is the value you provide.</li>\n<p> \t&#9632; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Be sure about your business model and how you are going to make money.</li>\n<p> \t&#9632; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Be clear about the life time value of what you do for your customers.</li>\n<p> \t&#9632; &nbsp;&nbsp;  And finally spend money as if it was your own.</li>\n<p>Technology is exciting, it can be your differentiation but by itself it cannot make your business successful.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Does leadership style required to steer a large organization differ from that of a startup? If yes, how does it differ?</strong></p>\n<p>One of the biggest difference is that in a large organization you are thinking long term. In a startup it is about the present, it is about surviving the week, the month, the year.</p>\n<p>An example. In a large organization you think of people as a long term asset, to be groomed, to be developed to realize the true potential. In startups people are talent that must be immediately put to use to deliver immediately.</p>\n<p>In a large organization you think about all your stakeholders and the consequences of your decisions and actions. These include customers, employees, shareholders, vendors, civil society, government, etc. In startups you tend to focus on existence and being successful in the short to mid term and focus on decisions and actions around those issues.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Is the hype around ‘Millennials’ a reality or exaggeration? Do leaders need to change their management style to cater to this new breed of workforce?</strong></p>\n<p>Millenials are different. You have to accept it. But if you have  a diverse and inclusive organization than millennials are just part of the diversity. So include them, respect them and help realize their ideas. If you do not have  a diverse organization than you will have to change your style not just for millennials but to embrace all the different types of diversity – gender, cultural, generations and differently abled.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><em><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-5444 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bhaskar-Pramanik.jpg?resize=243%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bhaskar Pramanik\" width=\"243\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bhaskar-Pramanik.jpg?resize=243%2C300&amp;ssl=1 243w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bhaskar-Pramanik.jpg?w=453&amp;ssl=1 453w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Bhaskar Pramanik, Chairman, Microsoft Corporation (India) Pvt.
