The changes have been taken with a vision to better communicate the breadth of expertise that EDGE truly represents.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">For this, EDGE underwent&nbsp;an extensive company-wide audit that included setting up Information Security Management System (ISMS), Privacy Information Management System (PIMS), Quality Management System (QMS) and putting 335+ controls company-wide.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">“In this endeavour, EDGE entrusted its faith with Varma &amp; Varma Financial Consulting, and DigiFortex Technologies. While the former counselled us on our ISO certifications, the latter helped us receive the SOC 2 Type II compliance. Both organizations advised us on Security, Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC), Penetration Testing (VA/PT), and Data Privacy Consulting Services, thereby reviewing our management systems and providing certifications to the standard. Both acted as independent third party specialists.”</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">ISO 27001, ISO 27701 and SOC 2 Type II are some of the most rigorous and well-regarded standards globally. Getting these certifications is a prodigious feat as it requires an astonishing amount of dedication and adherence to data policies. Measured against global benchmarks of industry excellence, it is the assurance that we have robust, clearly defined procedures in place in all our business areas such as IT, DevOps, Support, HR, Finance, Marketing, R&amp;D, Product Management and Documentation, amongst others.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">We are proud to be built with quality and transparency. We integrate these values into our daily work and ensure our products and services exceed client expectations. This is a stepping stone to serve our customers with global standards and leave them with an enthralling experience.&nbsp;</p>","slug":"edge-is-now-iso-27001-2013-and-iso-27701-2019-certified-and-soc-2-type-ii-compliant","subTitle":"\nEDGE has received international standard recognition and reiterated its commitment to ensure our products and services meet client requirements through effective quality, security and privacy management systems.","sizeInGrid":null,"meta_description":null,"metaDesc":null,"published_at":"2022-03-03T06:20:40.894Z","created_at":"2022-03-03T06:20:37.563Z","updated_at":"2022-03-08T09:56:17.520Z","featuredImage":{"id":720,"name":"blog-ISO-Certification.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1880,"height":1253,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_blog-ISO-Certification.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":9.74,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_blog-ISO-Certification.jpg","hash":"large_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":666,"size":91.69,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_blog-ISO-Certification.jpg","hash":"medium_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":59.04,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_blog-ISO-Certification.jpg","hash":"small_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":33.38,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7.jpg"}},"hash":"blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":213.58,"url":"/uploads/blog_ISO_Certification_615a8671d7.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2022-03-03T05:49:33.436Z","updated_at":"2022-03-03T05:49:33.498Z"},"categories":[{"id":1,"Name":"Industry News","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.560Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:13.950Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.593Z"},{"id":4,"Name":"Media & Events","published_at":"2021-02-23T05:53:20.022Z","created_at":"2021-02-23T05:53:03.263Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T05:53:20.063Z"}]},"setting":{"id":1,"onScroll":false,"timeBound":true,"seconds":"15","userLeaving":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T05:20:57.164Z","created_at":"2021-09-06T05:18:56.571Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T05:51:58.729Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
