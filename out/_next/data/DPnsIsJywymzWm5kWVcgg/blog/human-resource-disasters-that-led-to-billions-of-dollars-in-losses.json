The cost of repairs, logistics and forecasted net-loss in sales has been damaging the automaker’s dividends, with analysts predicting that the total dip in revenue attributed to the global recall would cross the USD 5 Billion mark over time! Moreover in 2010, the company lost over 100 Million$ a day on the stock market, as the recall triggered a massive panic sale of the company’s shares on various international exchanges.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The pandemonium was attested to the company’s </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">weak</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> attempt at cost-cutting measures for heightened profitability. The company had instructed designers and engineers to optimize the flooring mats in a bid to save money, whilst re-engineering the accelerator pedals for efficiency. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">However, the disaster was never fully associated with incapable employees or </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">unskilled labour</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, but rather an ineffective communication channel between employees and the management. In a detailed case study by </span><a href=\"https://www.ere.net/a-think-piece-how-hr-caused-toyota-to-crash/\"><span data-contrast=\"none\">Dr John Sullivan</span></a><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, Toyota hadn’t put in a lot of thought into its Employee Management and Skill Transformation divisions. Their &#8216;Rewards &amp; Recognition&#8217; program pushed employees to find numerous cost-cutting methodologies to improve the company’s expenditure, which only hampered the quality of the parts as employees probably didn’t know where to stop whilst cutting corners. The study also showed that the lack of adequate &#8216;Employee Upskilling and Training&#8217; proved to be detrimental to the organisation’s overall productivity!</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<div id=\"attachment_8774\" style=\"width: 788px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-8774\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8774\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toyota-meme-2.jpg?resize=778%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"778\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toyota-meme-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C659&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toyota-meme-2.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toyota-meme-2.jpg?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Toyota-meme-2.jpg?w=1191&amp;ssl=1 1191w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 778px) 100vw, 778px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-8774\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Image Source: Team BHP</p></div>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Know your employees before hiring them</span>.</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">More than 60% of companies across the globe have noted that the inability to narrow down their search for the right candidates, for diverse roles, has resulted in alarming rates of &#8216;<em>Employee Attrition</em>&#8216; and displeasure. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Whilst most analysts claim that the lack of transparency regarding an employee’s career trajectory within a company is a major contributing factor, some professionals claim that most recruiters are unaware of the job demands at hand whilst reaching out to prospective candidates. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Take the case of Thai Airways.
