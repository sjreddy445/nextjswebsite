It's now time to look at the top 5 trends that are poised to pave the way for 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>1. Data-driven recruiting will continue to grow in 2022 too! Data will be king and will define the way recruitment technologies are used.&nbsp;It will control how organisations hire the best candidate at the lowest possible time.<br><br>2. Tools that'll save sourcing to shortlisting time will be the call of the day. &nbsp;AI-based recruitment tools will improve and grow to match the right candidate with the right job.&nbsp;<br><br>3.

HR will recognise gig workers as an essential part of the workforce, bringing a much healthier mix of full-time, part-time contracts strung together, forming the&nbsp;core organisation.&nbsp;<br><br>5.
