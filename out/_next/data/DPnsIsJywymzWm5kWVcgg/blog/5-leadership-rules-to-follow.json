{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":558,"title":"5 Leadership Rules To Follow","content":"<p>\"A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way &amp; shows the way.\" &nbsp;â€” John Maxwell.</p><p>Many think that leadership is a tough nut to crack, and rightly so. Whatever a leader does is scrutinised. If you do it too much, you're a control freak; if you do it less, you're not serious.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where do you draw the line? What can you do to be known and respected as a leader, not a boss?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are our top 5 rules to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>Give credit where it's due</strong> - Be it your employees or peers, give credit to them for the hard work they've put in. It will increase their trust and respect for you. Don't brag only about yourself.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Don't follow the crowd</strong> - Don't go where others are walking. Pave your path. If you know, you're right - walk the path even if you're alone.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Take risks</strong> - You can only succeed if you move out of your comfort zone. Only then will you be able to achieve success.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Own your failures</strong> - You will fail at some point, and there are no two thoughts about it. However, it is essential to own them. Don't play a blame game. Sit back, introspect where you went wrong and try not to repeat them.<br><br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Understand 'metrics culture'</strong> - Everyone loves company culture. However, metrics is something not everyone has clarity about. Culture has usually been a subjective topic with no measurability or tracking. It's essential to promote this culture in the organization so that each one is aware of organizational goals and how to achieve them.</li></ol>","slug":"5-leadership-rules-to-follow","subTitle":"Where do you draw the line? \n\nWhat can you do to be known and respected as a leader, not a boss?\n\nFollow these top 5 leadership rules.","sizeInGrid":null,"meta_description":null,"metaDesc":null,"published_at":"2022-03-01T09:57:28.831Z","created_at":"2022-03-01T09:57:25.223Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T10:38:57.186Z","featuredImage":{"id":719,"name":"Top-5-leadership-rules.jpg","alternativeText":"","caption":"","width":1880,"height":1253,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Top-5-leadership-rules.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":7.53,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_Top-5-leadership-rules.jpg","hash":"large_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":666,"size":64.44,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Top-5-leadership-rules.jpg","hash":"medium_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":41.46,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_Top-5-leadership-rules.jpg","hash":"small_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":22.88,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065.jpg"}},"hash":"Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":176.36,"url":"/uploads/Top_5_leadership_rules_26dd499065.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2022-03-01T09:57:07.325Z","updated_at":"2022-03-01T09:57:07.381Z"},"categories":[{"id":2,"Name":"Expert Speak","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.494Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:32.816Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.527Z"}]},"setting":{"id":1,"onScroll":false,"timeBound":true,"seconds":"15","userLeaving":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T05:20:57.164Z","created_at":"2021-09-06T05:18:56.571Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T05:51:58.729Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
