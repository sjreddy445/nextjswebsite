HR professionals across firms of all sizes use Excel to accomplish their daily tasks. Ask anyone in the HR function and they will tell you how they love the application for its flexibility, user-friendliness and powerful modeling and analysis capabilities make it ideal for most HR processes.</p>\n<p>Well, the problem with spreadsheets is they require a huge amount of manual upkeep, often leave major room for human error, and simply can’t keep up with a growing business. Still, a lot of big as well as small and medium-sized businesses get cold feet when they’re presented with alternative options.</p>\n<p><em>Un-cloud the thinking  </em></p>\n<p>Cloud software isn’t just for big companies. In fact, many HR processes can easily be plugged into a system that’s built to help teams become more efficient. This could mean cost-effective, secure, doesn’t require a lot of overhead, and is easy to implement. Equally important and should not be ignored: switching over could save hours of time every week, so you can focus on the people-oriented work of human resources vs. the tedious transactional stuff.</p>\n<p>Most HR department in organizations probably rely on a combination of spreadsheets, PDFs, advisors, and services to handle the following processes: payroll, employee onboarding, employee information, performance evaluations, benefits enrollment and changes, recruiting and applicant tracking, employee scheduling, leave management, data analysis decision making.</p>\n<p><em>Address the myths: Spreadsheet vs Cloud</em></p>\n<p><em> </em><strong>Myth #1: Loss of data</strong></p>\n<p>Fearing the loss of data isn’t entirely unwarranted, but those fears can easily be alleviated by the simple fact that you can routinely export and backup your data from pretty much any service you use. If it makes you feel better, you could initially keep your spreadsheets while reaping the rewards of software solutions built to automate many of your processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #2: Compromised security</strong></p>\n<p>Security is top of mind for every company, whether you have an IT team or not. And rightfully so. Thankfully, moving away from your spreadsheets is likely the more secure choice for your business. These days, cloud applications are much more secure than on premise databases or spreadsheets on someone else’s computer. The bottom line? The services available to you have gone through rigorous hoops in order to ensure their compliance and your security.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #3: Additional costs</strong></p>\n<p>The costs of a spreadsheet are close to zero and specialized tools and services can feel like a big commitment for a small or medium-sized business. The good news is that there are increasingly more tools and services made for businesses of all kinds and sizes. They also come at various price points &#8211; some tools have been developed to be budget-friendly and powerful at the same time. And some are even offered free for you to try out!</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #4: Job loss </strong></p>\n<p>As computers and automation take on more and more processes, many fear that humans will gradually be replaced. The truth is that automating manual processes can actually free employees’ time to work on more strategic projects that greatly benefit their organization. A lot of the transactional work HR professionals are familiar with will be optimized by the technology you switch to and you’ll find your employees doing a lot more high-level work that actually can’t be done by machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Myth #5: Adding complexity </strong></p>\n<p>Cloud-based services can easily integrate with other tools and products so you can sync your data in the background, while you’re doing other work. That’s the magic of APIs. Once your data is in one centralized system, it can then communicate with other providers. Your spreadsheets can’t do this type of work for you, but cloud-based software services are up to the task. In the end, the mix of technology and a trusted advisor/vendor can help you automate tedious workflows and save you time (and money) by helping you fine tune your plans.</p>\n<p>So now that you have all the information, make the switch from your old spreadsheet routine to a new cloud-based software system. The sooner you take that leap, the better positioned you’ll be to optimize and grow your business and employees!</p>\n<p><em>We’d love to interact with you.
