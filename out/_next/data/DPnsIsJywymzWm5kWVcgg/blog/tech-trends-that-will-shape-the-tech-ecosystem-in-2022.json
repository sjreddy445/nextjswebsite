{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":547,"title":"TechTrends that will shape the TechEcosystem In 2022","content":"<p>Much before the pandemic set in, the use of various technologies to make life simpler and easier for the customer had been a rage in India. The pandemic only gave impetus to it. And with it flourished new enterprises, consumers, and categories.&nbsp;</p><p>Experts believe that some of these changes may have long-term implications, so it is vital to acquire the skills necessary to be in the business. In terms of technology, there are five critical skills that professionals need to be adept in.</p><p>1. AI - The main objective of AI is to have decision-making capabilities like human beings. Thus, the need to make technology and its experience, at the end-user level, richer and smoother while maintaining accuracy calls for the development of new technologies in artificial intelligence. PwC states that by 2030 this futuristic technology can contribute over $15.7 Trillion to the global economy.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Machine learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are a branch of artificial intelligence and are used to train the machine to understand human languages and make decisions based on the given input, like Google Assistant, Siri and Alexa. In the future, AI could be combined with other technologies to provide much more powerful capabilities and potentially change the way things work at present. By 2022, the majority of the companies are expected to&nbsp;widely adopt AI&nbsp;for their business operations.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Data Science - The need to reach customers effectively with widespread options at the least possible time calls for intelligent data analytics. Here’s how efficient data analytics can help:</p><p>a. Identify the potential client base</p><p>b. Predictive analysis for identifying what suits a particular user</p><p>c. Bringing the right services/products to the customer to increase reach and in turn, add to ROI.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. BlockChain - The data in the blockchain are encrypted and stored in a hash format and all blocks in the network interconnect. Hence to access a single block, the entire network has to be accessed. Without the right keys, it is impossible to decrypt the data in a blockchain network. This makes blockchain very effective against cyberattacks and data leakages. The&nbsp;total revenue spent&nbsp;globally on blockchain solutions is expected to be 6.6 billion by 2024.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Cloud services: An integral part of the system today, it saves a lot of time and effort in maintaining and managing local databases without any data leakages or cyberattacks. With cloud service, the data becomes more flexible as it could be accessed from anywhere. All of these processes of maintenance and management will be done by the cloud service provider.</p><p>It can also offer disaster recovery management to protect the data in case of any disaster and promises less downtime when compared to locally managed data centres. According to&nbsp;Gartner’s prediction, the public cloud service market is expected to reach about $397.4 billion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Networking and #Interconnectivity technologies will see a growing demand for a skilled workforce. Developments at all levels of the network stack will continue to drive research and the Internet economy. OpenFlow and SDN will make networks more secure, transparent, flexible, and functional.</p>","slug":"tech-trends-that-will-shape-the-tech-ecosystem-in-2022","subTitle":"Experts believe that some of the technological changes brought by the pandemic may have long-term implications, so it is vital to acquire the skills necessary to be in the business.
