This in turn reduces an organisation’s top-line, which&nbsp;inevitably&nbsp;hurts&nbsp;stakeholders across the enterprise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the onset of digitization, automation and intelligent systems, analysts predicted a global shift in the&nbsp;hiring order. Jobs and skillsets that were relevant today, would slowly start to become irrelevant by the dawn of the next decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And this calculated&nbsp;assumption&nbsp;has held its ground. Over the last 5 years, various IT and Tech&nbsp;related&nbsp;job profiles have either become obsolete or redundant.&nbsp;And inevitably, a regular job profile has evolved into an entity that requires new skills and experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In light of this&nbsp;cataclysmic&nbsp;shift, organisations are finding it increasingly&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to source the right talent.&nbsp;The hiring&nbsp;methodology&nbsp;that relied on ‘Human&nbsp;Instincts’ is gravely flawed and has resulted in over 40% of organisations declaring that they lack ‘Qualified&nbsp;Talent’.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what went wrong? Why has the entire Talent Acquisition pipeline&nbsp;for an enterprise turned sour?&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is simple:&nbsp;inadequate disruption across the hiring channel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With the arrival of intelligent platforms powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), the ability to process data and infer insights became a regular norm for enterprises all over. By applying the same concept to the hiring process, companies have seen a noticeable improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Over&nbsp;22% of organisations utilising AI-ML for talent related decisions have fared better than others in the departments of hiring, retention and diversity. How?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Finding the right talent: Bad hires v/s Bottom-line</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>No longer a novelty in the space of hiring, AI has made its entry into the field by displaying immediate results.&nbsp;With the help of ‘Contextual Analysis’ and ‘Data&nbsp;Analytics’, AI platforms were able to identify prospective employees&nbsp;by inferring their overall qualification, experience and skill-sets possessed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By doing so effectively, the platform is able to source the right talent for diverse profiles,&nbsp;departments&nbsp;and verticals with lesser time.&nbsp;Furthermore, by assessing overall fitment, the right candidate is sourced accurately. Companies spend over&nbsp;10,000 USD annually&nbsp;to train a single employee. Hence, bad hires affect the bottom-line.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Internal Fulfilment for Cost Effectiveness</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>In the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak, organisations all over the world are now looking to fulfil arising job openings by sourcing the right talent internally.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Workforce Optimization has gone beyond resource utilization, and will now become a matter of corporate profits. In order to reduce hiring and training costs, organisations&nbsp;are deploying AI-powered platforms to&nbsp;optimise their bench.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Benched candidates, that are suitable for other openings across the enterprise, can be allocated immediately. Furthermore, with the help of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edgenetworks.in/talent-transformation/\">Intelligent Learning Recommendations</a>, these benched executives can be up-skilled&nbsp;appropriately&nbsp;to&nbsp;undertake new profiles and&nbsp;job roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Removing the Human Bias</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Researchers have stated that the&nbsp;<i>Human Bias</i>&nbsp;has been repeatedly responsible for bad hires. Hiring Managers that rely on their gut instincts, do so without quantifying the logic behind undertaking a hiring decision. Often, the best employee is ignored in favour of a flamboyant&nbsp;smooth-talker, which could yield poor results for a company.&nbsp;It has been observed that, that an average IT/ITeS&nbsp;enterprise spends over 250,000 USD for training new hires.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AI-powered talent decision platforms&nbsp;have the ability&nbsp;to scan through a resume, gauge skill-sets and appropriately stack-rank them according to fitment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through this process, a hiring manager can see the most ideal candidates based on their overall score. Also, by setting certain&nbsp;constraints/filters, the most ideal fit for a company can be sourced quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The positive attributes behind an AI-powered Talent Acquisition platform are far beyond what you’ve just read. The platform&nbsp;taxonomizes&nbsp;the skill-sets, breaks down hiring bottlenecks, reduces the hiring cycle-time etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, at a time when saving money is of utmost importance for an organisation, spending millions on bad hires shouldn’t be in existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>","slug":"how-can-an-enterprise-increase-its-overall-revenue-by-deploying-an-ai-powered-talent-acquisition-platform","subTitle":"<p>Surveys and reports have shown that over 28% of future job openings will go unfulfilled, resulting in a loss of billable work hours.
