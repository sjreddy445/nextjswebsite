Cost saving, ofcourse.</p>\n<p>But that’s only the ‘tip of the iceberg!’ There’s more – so much more – and the possibilities can be fascinating as they can be game changing. Today, HR functions across the world are in the process of enhancing or considering intelligent process automation.</p>\n<p>By looking beyond cost savings, the real value of intelligent automation emerges from upgrading business process and emphasizing people first. This is where HR can really show its chops – bringing together the art and science of talent.</p>\n<p>Simply put, by taking over straightforward and repetitive tasks, intelligent automation allows people to focus on jobs that require uniquely human characteristics. And this opens up a whole new range of business possibilities. But first, it’s prudent to view it as a journey guided by organizational need, systematic outcome, and informed choices.</p>\n<p><strong>Optimize intellectual capital</strong></p>\n<p>Making the right use of HR people’s talents and capabilities for managing and guiding a workforce is critical for any company. Automating HR processes allows them to take up tasks that really matter for business growth and development.</p>\n<p>Often it has been observed that intelligent automation process help repurpose the HR talent pool, and guides them toward more strategic contributions.</p>\n<p><strong>Decision-making backed by data</strong></p>\n<p>Recruitment, applicant tracking, performance management, goal setting and tracking – HR automated solutions make it possible to perform all these tasks better, more quickly,  precisely and efficiently than ever before. The data from all these processes and practices enable an organization’s leadership to make better decisions.</p>\n<p>This data can provide rich insights used for planning, enhancing productivity, outperforming competition and more.</p>\n<p><strong>Reduce security issues and human errors</strong></p>\n<p>HR data is precious and security concerns around it will always be high. The self-automated HR system leaves less chances of lapses due to human error and security issues. It takes care of verifying users before sending or sharing confidential documents and can even reduce the chances of losing important documents.</p>\n<p>By taking a logical route to deploy HR automation across processes, HR can be assured of a more secure and precise way of working and looking at talent management that is more aligned to the business.</p>\n<p><strong>From doing things differently to doing different things </strong></p>\n<p>When approached systematically and holistically, intelligent automation can propel organizations across limiting ceilings.</p>\n<p>Take for example the movement from data gathering on employee performance &#8211; to using predictive analytics to make valuable HR decisions about hiring, demand and supply forecasting, career paths and progression, attrition, talent transformation and more.</p>\n<p>As the automation journey progresses, HR leaders will be compelled to think beyond cost saving. And look beyond the visible benefits – at more strategic areas. They can then ask the larger questions: What are the big challenges that our organization, employees and stakeholders are facing? How can automation technology help improve business processes to address them? Other than costs savings, what extra value does the intelligence in our enterprise’s automation tools provide, such as insights or scalability?</p>\n<p>Sounds exciting! The future belongs to those organizations who harness the power of automation wisely, and make the shift from doing things differently to doing different things.</p>\n<p><strong> </strong><em>If you enjoyed the article please leave us a comment and we will get back to you.</em></p>\n","slug":"intelligent-automation","subTitle":"<p>So what’s the first thing that comes to mind when you think automation?
