{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":447,"title":"Reskilling for the AI world","content":"<p><strong>AI is the new power tool.</strong></p>\n<p>It is ubiquitous today and evident from the fact that all businesses, irrespective of size and maturity are paying heed to AI and adopting it to become more efficient. While AI continues to master an increasing number of jobs and make its foray into more and more functions of business, there is a great need for human talent to upskill and upgrade.</p>\n<p>A lot of emphasis is being given to employee reskilling as organizations foresee repetitive or redundant jobs being taken over by technology &#8211; and new and evolved job functions being created.</p>\n<p>However, new job creation has remained bleak as many organisations are still figuring their way out of the clutches of machines that are taking away their work. This is evident from the stats presented in Naukri Job Speak Index 2017 report. The report states that the overall job market saw an 11% decline in new jobs, with IT software industry being the worst hit.  In the previous year, the same report stated a 27%growth in new jobs, with IT software and ITes industry leading in job creation.</p>\n<p><strong>Tough times ahead</strong></p>\n<p>The stats mentioned above clearly indicate a volatile job market. The situation is definitely overwhelming for employees across sectors given with the talk of jobless growth. The only way out for them is to understand the market well and acquire skills which will help them not only remain relevant in the job market but also help them evolve and progress at the workplace.</p>\n<p><strong>Prepare to take over machines</strong></p>\n<p>As people are being pitted against machines, reskilling oneself to excel at the workplace has become critical. Employees need to evaluate their current and future roles and seek out skills that will allow them to win the automation battle.</p>\n<p>According to a joint report by enterprise technology learning company Pluralsight and market research firm KANTAR IMRB, 97% of IT professionals believe in the importance of building one’s technology skills and 74 percent of them have undergone learning programs in 2016. The numbers are a respite as it testifies that workforce is gearing itself up for the future.</p>\n<p>However, there is another interesting side to the automation fear. Researchers say that with help of certain algorithms, humans can plan to ask machines to determine what skills they will require to possess to stay on top of their game. Interesting, isn’t it?</p>\n<p>According to a Deloitte <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/finance/articles/technology-and-people.html\">report</a>, technology actually created more jobs than it destroyed in the last 144 years and even saved human workforce from dull, repetitive and dangerous work.</p>\n<p>Similarly, areas like AI and Robotics will pave the way for a more evolved role for humans at the workplace, leading to more innovative jobs and roles.</p>\n<p>Not only employees, but organisations too will need to pay greater emphasis on employees’ learning needs with changing industry requirements. CEOs and CHROs will need to work in tandem to make reskilling a business-critical mission and invest heavily in learning and development programs to nurture existing and potential talent.</p>\n<p><em>Let us know what you think of this blog in the comment section below!</em></p>\n","slug":"reskilling-ai-world","subTitle":"<p>AI is the new power tool.
