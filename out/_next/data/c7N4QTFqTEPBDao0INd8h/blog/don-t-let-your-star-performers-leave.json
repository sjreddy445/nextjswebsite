The answer lies within - it is the amalgamation of all of the aforementioned; he or she is the ‘Star Performer’ or the Stakhanovite as we may call them. They take initiative, deliver results, communicate well, are passionate about the work they do, and have utmost integrity. They are the jewels in the company’s crown and the last thing you’d want is for them to quit.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">While most companies emphasize on hiring the best of talents, the effort should be equal or at times more to retain them. The most common mistake that most organizations commit is over-burdening their employees with work and eventually lead them to burn out. This often leads to attrition among the star employees.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Studies and surveys have revealed that high performing employees quit an organization for 3 most common reasons-</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">1. Excessive work pressure or disproportionate work-life balance</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">2. Being offered a considerable hike in compensation and benefits</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">3. To explore career development or new experience options</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">With the hunt for talent growing more and more challenging, it has become imperative for organizations to retain high-performing employees, not only to ensure steady growth but also to avoid a cost and time burn in terms of training a new hire to adapt to the company culture.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Let us look at some easy and effective measures that organizations can adopt to curb attrition among the star performers.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Avoid employee burn out</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The first thing that companies must pay heed is to curb over-burdening employees with work. Stretching work hours on a regular basis not only plays with the employees’ work-life balance but also adversely affects one's mental and physical wellbeing. Employees too might take up additional tasks assigned by their managers to keep the achievement momentum on, often even more than one can handle, especially during challenging periods, the pandemic in this case.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">According to the Achievers Workforce Institute Engagement and Retention Report for 2021, 51 per cent of employees currently working from home think that their supervisor doubts their productivity. This is bound to contribute to employee burnout since most of them - almost 44 percent – are prompted to log onto work earlier or stay online later.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This gives a toss to the essential work-life balance that one intends to maintain leading the employee towards health issues.&nbsp;The same report mentions that a whopping 52 per cent of employees will job hunt in 2021 — up from 35 per cent in 2020. Among these 25 per cent are striving for a better work-life balance while 35 percent are looking for better compensation benefits.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Acknowledge achievements</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">To retain its workforce, organizations must ensure that employees are trusted upon,&nbsp; acknowledged for every achievement and milestone that&nbsp;they reach. And the onus lies on the immediate superior the employee is dealing with. The report states that more than a third of employees feel that they are not recognized by their superiors; while a whopping 69 percent feel that their motivation and relationships within the organization would improve if their managers acknowledged their milestones. &nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Thus, it is pertinent to take time out for&nbsp;effective employee engagement programs. While periodic reviews and assessments offer constructive feedback,&nbsp;it is crucial to&nbsp;offer apt&nbsp;solutions or suggestions to overcome those little hurdles that employees may face in their daily work.&nbsp;Over&nbsp;66 per cent of employees would be more engaged at work if employers improved company culture, while&nbsp;almost 52 percent&nbsp;would be more engaged if their employer improved its diversity and inclusion. To put things in perspective, the&nbsp;power of a&nbsp;‘thank you’ is often underestimated&nbsp;yet&nbsp;its effects in&nbsp;creating a culture of recognition, that&nbsp;not only reduces turnover but increases engagement and productivity at the same time, can never be undermined.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Design employee engagement programs&nbsp;</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It is rightly said that organizations are like families. The stronger the bonds are between the employees and employers, the more likely are the employees to stick to the organization. It is thus a necessity to prepare a well-knit employee communication network and employee engagement programs to ensure the employee feels connected to the company. This becomes even more important when situations like the current pandemic force employees to work out of their homes.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The latest study shows that more and more employees today, are feeling less connected to their company or colleagues since the start of the pandemic. About 42 percent of the workforce believes that company culture has diminished since the onset of the pandemic, with most employees&nbsp;blaming&nbsp;lack of communication&nbsp;and effort to make remote employees feel connected.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Offer career development opportunities</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Studies have revealed that organizations that offer career development options have a higher retention rate compared to those who don’t. It could be in the form of opening lateral and vertical movements within the company or sponsoring higher education, career development through training and seminars, participating in national as well as global events and competitions, etc.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Many organizations have adopted voluntary skill development centers where employees can reskill and upskill themselves without having to take sabbaticals. Employees who are always craving more knowledge and skill development, take heed in addressing their needs.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Offer competitive compensations and benefits</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">According to the latest Achievers Workforce Institute survey, more than half the&nbsp;employees plan to look for a new job in 2021 -&nbsp;up from 43 per cent in 2019 and35 per cent in 2020 respectively. The reasons as mentioned above are competitive pay packages and better work-life balance.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Good pay packages and additional perks and benefits like health, life, or disability insurances, academic sabbaticals, tuition fee reimbursement/sponsorship, paid holidays and vacations, ESOP options, etc.&nbsp;are crucial&nbsp;to attract and retain top talents.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">With a great company culture and employee-friendly policies, organizations can not only ensure a cut in attrition but also head up in the race for the most preferred workplaces.
