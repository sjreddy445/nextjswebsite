We are in conversation with Dinesh Menon, our Head of Business Operations. We talk about how hirings are poised for growth and how EDGE Recruit, our latest AI product, will set benchmarks for the hirings of the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> Please tell us a little about yourself, and then we'll go directly to the questions.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Dinesh Menon:</strong> Sure. Thank you. I used to be an HR practitioner for more than a decade. I joined EDGE three years back to manage customer success, and I currently manage the business operations. It's been a pleasure being here.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;So, Dinesh, we were having this conversation before the interview where we were discussing the Future Workforce 2021 Global Outlook report. And it gives us some very interesting insights. It says 82% of employers plan on hiring in 2021. Of these, 37% plan to rehire to backfill jobs, and 35% plan to hire new positions.&nbsp;</p><p>So now, according to you, what are the morbid challenges that are faced by organizations today in hiring - getting the right kind of talent for the right job? What is the current scenario? And how do you think an effective talent management solution can solve this concern?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Dinesh Menon:</strong>&nbsp;Right. Yeah, I mean, I think the core that is, and I think it's been a problem for a while now&nbsp;-&nbsp;finding&nbsp;the right person&nbsp;for&nbsp;the right job. I think that remains to be done – the problems around how to source and how to hire have changed. So let's look at the last year. In respect of COVID&nbsp;and all that's happened around us, attrition has increased across the industry, right?&nbsp;Look at it,&nbsp;the industry attrition has gone up, which means refills are going to happen.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;of the large ones have their order books complete&nbsp;for the year and for years to come. What does that mean?&nbsp;They're gonna hire a lot more. You know, we have here companies, couple of our customers speak about hiring in few 1000s,&nbsp;of times peak mechanics&nbsp;-&nbsp;1000s in a year, which means hiring is going to stay.&nbsp;The recruitment fraternity is really seeing a new wave of high attrition recruiters because the demand for recruiters has increased. And because of this, a lot of companies are having a brain drain, if I could use the word in terms of recruitment as a function.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A company hires, recruiter invests time, trains him or her to be a good record and starts getting productive. And then you see the recruiter move out, you know, and we've seen that, in my experience, I've seen that across customers where I've seen a specific recruiter&nbsp;leave because the customer's location has moved to another&nbsp;zone so on so forth. Because then there is demand for recruiters, there is significant hiring happening. And there's loss from a brand standpoint we're looking at. So what really can help is obviously automation. Like being able to know, the learnings from recruitment that has happened in the past&nbsp;-&nbsp;the ability for a perfect system to come in and reduce time in terms of hiring, which will then obviously, reduce time in terms of facilities, costs will increase profitability, and so on, so forth. So I think a good recruitment system, automated recruitment software is the need of the hour. Yeah, I mean, it's been there for some time in the markets. It's not that it's a new concept. But how efficient are those is a big question.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;Right? So&nbsp;like you said,&nbsp;there are a couple of solutions in the market. So&nbsp;on that front,&nbsp;how effective are they vis-a-vie&nbsp;EDGE Recruit, our AI product?&nbsp;And on that&nbsp;front, what day to day problem&nbsp;will it solve for recruiters?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Dinesh Menon:</strong>&nbsp;So,&nbsp;let's&nbsp;look at it this way - let's break a recruiter’s life into maybe four or five&nbsp;phases - demand generation, sourcing, video selection, assessment, and onboarding. Now,&nbsp;where does a&nbsp;recruiter spend most of his&nbsp;time?&nbsp;Sourcing and sharing. And because of this today, if you really look at it, many recruiters are not&nbsp;doing a&nbsp;recruiters job because they are just busy getting a CV, running it through&nbsp;the&nbsp;TA team and&nbsp;pushing it across. They&nbsp;aren’t&nbsp;really doing the interview process, which they're hired for. What is the recruiter’s job, what is the value a recruiter brings? It is&nbsp;to really interview&nbsp;a person, understand the candidate’s profile, understand what he or she knows, what the job requires, see a match in terms of the fitment in terms of behaviour, or skill sets, in terms of culture fit, and so on, so forth.&nbsp;However, today, most of them aren’t able to do that because they are running behind the&nbsp;TA team, which is itself, you know,&nbsp;is a&nbsp;high-pressure&nbsp;job. Now that's where the beauty of&nbsp;Recruit really comes in, how&nbsp;Recruit is being built.&nbsp;It is&nbsp;built on the concept of mimicking&nbsp;a&nbsp;recruiter’s brain.&nbsp;Just think about the fact that you're mimicking a&nbsp;recruiter’s brain into an application, you're marrying the same thing with artificial intelligence, and AI is something an over&nbsp;abused word. Everyone has AI in everything these days. But it's important, though, what&nbsp;Recruit&nbsp;brings in.&nbsp;So the AI in recruit is based on learnings from close to 35 million-plus profiles across the globe and 10 million job descriptions.&nbsp;So it's learned to looking at all these data sets, understand what a job family is, role as a skill is, and then marry what a recruiter will look for.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">What're the first few things a recruiter looks for in a resume? The profile obviously, but the compensation, the notice period, where the person is located etc., is important too! You know, the experience a person brings in this case, and the skills and the, you know, the different experiences from a product standpoint that the person brings in, and so on, so forth. Now, that's where EDGE Recruit is able to really bring a big difference - it really helps reduce your sourcing time significantly. Having used the product for our own organization, I think we’ll easily save about 50 to 60% of our time on sourcing. Then comes the other functionalities in terms of, you know, scheduling etc. Once the right person is identified with the help of EDGE Recruit, it's about going into the next stages of the hiring, like I said earlier, that you have assessments and so on, so forth, and you can move in, so that it really brings in value in terms of sourcing, helping you source the right person in a much, much effective way. And you know, that not only reduces turnaround time but your costs and enhances the quality of the CVs that come. This streamlines operations and ensures a recruiter’s exit doesn’t hamper the brand deeply. The recruiter leaves the learnings, or they're in the system with EDGE Recruit, the new recruiter comes and starts using the same system. Right? The system has learned. So, the knowledge management around the brand stands intact.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;Great. So, yes, you know we've used EDGE Recruit ourselves. What are the benefits that we've seen, from an organization perspective, and what do you think the business impacts or the benefits EDGE Recruit will bring to the industry per se?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Dinesh Menon:</strong>&nbsp;So, the way I look at it is as I mean, it could be a repetition of what I just said earlier, is that you know, clearly recruit helps you source faster, it gets you the right kind of people that you want, right. And if I look at organizations, the large brands get around 15,000 to 20,000 CV’s which come in a month or so. That’s a huge untapped treasure just lying somewhere. If they can exploit all of it, use what they have, instead of spending money on either vendor or through portals, they can reduce cost significantly, right? So, you can reduce costs; you can start engaging with your employees, get employee referrals in place and use all of these effectively. Every business leader would want to end the day seeing like-minded people or the right quality people coming in? That's good engagement. Right? So you, you not only are reducing costs, and you know, increasing, reducing your turn around times, but also starting to engage them. If you use EDGE Recruit the right way, you can also make sure that you're building a process system ready for scale. Because what happens is, as I already said, the system has a capability to learn, and it also has a capability in terms of capturing the learnings.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> Great. So, you know, Dinesh, quite an insight that you've given us on EDGE Recruit, and, you know, I feel that the, in the business impacts of benefit are quite far-fetched, It will basically if I could say it will act as a catalyst for change of our organizations.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Dinesh Menon:</strong> And especially in this in this zone, where we are aware, most companies are hiring a lot of people, hiring people with specific skill sets, companies are starting to spend money and compensation based on skill sets. There’s a brilliant tool there because it can really capture a candidate's skill sets and match them with the graph/ JD that the recruiter has. So it can really call out and highlight the quality of the skill set even before the interview is done. If you're already getting pre-qualified CVs for hiring managers to start hiring, hiring managers to think that's great.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Watch the video here <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3cETuuV\">https://bit.ly/3cETuuV</a></p>","slug":"edge-recruit-mimicking-the-recruiter-s-brain","subTitle":"Anannya Debnath, Content Lead at EDGE in conversation with Dinesh Menon, our Head of Business Operations.
