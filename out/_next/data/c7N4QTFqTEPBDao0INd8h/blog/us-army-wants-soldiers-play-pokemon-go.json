The massively popular game even has CXO level leaders caught in its frenzy. People are driving straight into lakes to catch Pokémons and some are even buying a second smartphone for the sole purpose of playing the game.</p>\n<p>However, as HR fans, this one is our favourite!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://qz.com/741567/the-us-navy-resorted-to-pokemon-go-as-a-recruitment-strategy/\">The US Navy resorted to Pokémon Go as a recruitment strategy</a></p>\n<p>Although the move invited some criticism, it is not the first time that HR has resorted to games to attract, engage and retain employees. With advances in HR Technology, organisations are employing new techniques to get the best talent.</p>\n<p>Organisations’ growing interest in gamification can be explained by the findings from a <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\">research</a> by Gallup. According to the study, while millennials will constitute up to 75% of the workforce by 2025, they are the least engaged employees at work. Only 28.9% millennials feel engaged at work as compared to 32.9% Gen X and boomers. This is exactly where gamification can come to HR’s rescue. Using gamification can not only help increase engagement levels amongst employees, but also help attract the best talent.</p>\n<p>A recent report by Elon University stated that 53 percent Internet experts predict there will be significant advances in the usage and adoption of gamification in the workplace by 2020. Infact, the HR departments of Fortune 500 companies are already launching gamification pilots.</p>\n<p>One would wonder how something as puerile as video games could mean serious business.  Gamification taps into the innate competitiveness of candidates and employees to help them perform better. The thrill of unlocking a new stage, collecting more badges and setting new records motivates employees to go the extra mile and work harder to gain more and more rewards.</p>\n<p>One of the first organisations to experiment with gamification in HR was the U.S Army. It’s highly successful game, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFc36ysBZ0A\">America’s Army</a>, helped the young generation of USA develop a keen interest to join the armed forces. The result? Army recruitments shot up.</p>\n<p>Following the success of the video game, the US army also created an army experience centre in Philadelphia where potential recruits could get a hands on experience of different army roles, bases and duties using computers and the Xbox 360. Now that’s what we call walking the talk! We couldn’t have asked for a better job description.</p>\n<p>Now that gamification was the new buzzword in HR town, some of the largest brands soon followed suit. Here’s how L’Oréal, Danone and Marriot carried out some of the best HR drives using gamification.</p>\n<h3><strong>Reveal by L’Oréal</strong></h3>\n<p>Want to work for L’Oréal? Why don’t you show them how good you are?</p>\n<p>Yup! That’s exactly what L’Oréal asked it’s potential recruits to do. The global beauty brand invited applications by asking candidates to play a virtual game.  The players played the role of a management trainee for the launch of a new L’Oréal product. To progress, the players had to solve puzzles and search clues. The game allowed the players to learn more about the brand and also about their professional skills. Check it out <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tzKIfbw_d0Q\">here.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>Trust by Danone</strong></h3>\n<p>Much like Loreal, Danone asked it’s potential recruits to don the hat of the head of the company for it’s game- Trust.</p>\n<p>Players had to go through different stages starting from manufacturing right up to distribution in order to progress. What could be a better way to introduce potential candidates to job roles? Danone had it bang on! Learn more about their campaign <a href=\"https://youtu.be/irzoP1JsWbY\">here.</a></p>\n<h3><strong>My Marriot by Marriot</strong></h3>\n<p>The hospitality industry is a demanding one.</p>\n<p>The perfect candidate would be one who can handle a crisis any time it happens and work under loads of pressure. Marriot resorted to a virtual game to test the skills of it’s potential recruits. The players were allotted a virtual manager who would guide them in different stages of the game and also give instructions. The game allowed players to get a virtual tour of the industry they were about to step in.
