Increase diversity and inclusive hiring by managing candidate sourcing well. A great way to ensure that your talent pool is full of diverse candidates is to source your candidates from various places.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Develop D&amp;I training programs for HR —&nbsp;</strong>This will help HR teams to understand how cultural differences can impact the way people work and interact. It could include working out of different time zones, altered communication styles, self-identity to their reactions and response in times of conflict.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Increase your diversity hiring in candidate screening&nbsp;</strong>— The criteria for hiring usually include demographic and geographical information. To have D&amp;I goals in the organizations' road map, it is essential to use tools and intelligent systems to hide those biases and promote hiring based on merit and skills.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Invest in smart recruitment technology&nbsp;</strong>— Implement an application tracking system with built-in intelligence that helps reduce bias and assists objective decision-making.
