{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":358,"title":"Happy Independence Day, Folks!","content":"<p>At the stroke of the midnight hour, on August 15, 1947, India got its freedom. And so began our story as an independent India. This weekend, as we celebrate our 69th Independence Day, we need to applaud our achievements as well as examine the issues that India still needs to get its freedom from.</p>\n<p>Given our long journey and the challenges we have overcome as a nation, one could say the achievements are remarkable. Today, India is a force to be reckoned with, both politically and economically.</p>\n<p>However, there are large issues we still need to address as a nation: hunger, poverty, corruption, illiteracy, unemployment, and violence against women, to name a few. India today needs multiple reforms that will have a positive impact on each and every one of us, and benefit society as a whole.</p>\n<p>The government has announced a variety of measures to accelerate the process of growth with equity and sustainability. Today we see the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan in action, a national campaign to clean the streets, roads and infrastructure of the country &#8211; India&#8217;s biggest cleanliness drive ever!</p>\n<p>Make in India is another exciting initiative by the government to encourage companies manufacture their products in India. The major objective behind the large-scale endeavour is to focus on 25 sectors of the economy for job creation and skill enhancement. If successful, we will see increases in GDP growth and tax revenue; high quality standards; and inflows of capital and technological investment. Drivers that will accelerate our development and progress.</p>\n<p>Another major initiative is the Skill India initiative. Designed to start projects to train 40 crore people in various skills by 2022, this is an ambitious and much needed program in India. For this initiative to truly succeed, it is essential its effects trickle down to the state level, with the states forming the necessary functional missions to take it forward. Our citizens not only need the necessary vocational and skill training &#8211; they also need long-term, gainful employment after receiving the skill training. Gender inclusion is also of vital importance in this program.</p>\n<p>We, at EdGE Networks are inspired and driven by this shared vision. We wish each and every one of you- our customers, partners, vendors, and last but not the least, our employees &#8211; a Happy Independence Day. And on this very special occasion, we strengthen our resolve to continuously strive to develop skills for various industries, and help connect the right people to the right job. It will be our unrelenting endeavour to create a community of skilled manpower, impacting and benefiting our country.</p>\n","slug":"happy-independence-day-folks","subTitle":"<p>At the stroke of the midnight hour, on August 15, 1947, India got its freedom.
