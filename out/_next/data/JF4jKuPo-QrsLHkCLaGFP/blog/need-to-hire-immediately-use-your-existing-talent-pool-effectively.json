{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":536,"title":"Need To Hire Immediately? Use Your Existing Talent Pool Effectively.","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Need to fill a position within the shortest time possible? Your reporting and hiring managers are following up relentlessly to close the position at the earliest? How do you deal with such a situation?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">You do not have any more time to hire from external sources, and the resumes received in the past few weeks haven't met your expectations. What do you do?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Well, you may not tend to realize but the resume pool that you've created over the years is one of your most valuable assets, but you're not making the most out of it. It is a potential goldmine that, when used optimally, will save significant time and effort. According to an industry report, 67% of large companies and 56% of medium-sized organizations have difficulty filling positions.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This repository of different resumes collected over time has been created either through career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves going and getting some resumes. So, organizations have a repository, but you can think of it as more or less just a database, which was never maintained. You would find a resume lying in there, which was acquired some time ago but never used. Either the applicant didn't meet the job criteria, was a second choice to the position, or were not available. It means that the candidate was not hired for the particular position, and their resume is just lying in the repository without any meaningful use.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is where EDGE Recruit comes in and plays a significant role in the hiring circle. Recruit isn't merely a system of workflow but a system of intelligence. The product is integrated with multiple applications and platforms that make the task of hiring simplified and effortless. The brain behind EDGE Recruit is our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, when you have a task in hand, all you're trying to, as a recruiter, do is try to find the best possible candidates who can fulfil this position. EDGE Recruit helps you do just that. From collaborative hiring to storing a candidate's holistic profile, our AI-enabled product possesses the capability to parse through a gamut of profiles within few seconds. It then provides you with instant and accurate matches for a job description based on criteria like skillsets, diversity or location, while tackling unintentional and unconscious bias. Recruiters can also search for candidates based on time and cost sensitivities enabling improved conversion rates.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">A candidate who may not have been hired earlier may have better opportunities within the organization in different roles. It enables HR to pick the resume from archives and see if they match some other job? And it might turn out that there might be a better opportunity awaiting them, apart from what they applied for. EDGE Recruit provides for this matching, where one part of the flow is you have a job in hand, and you're just trying to find the matching candidates for that job.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">The other way around is also possible; you have a resume in hand, and it looks good. It might not be a good fit for the opening you have presently, because as a recruiter, your visibility is restricted to few jobs that match your own. But if the resume is part of the talent pool, there's an ability to figure out if this person fits other jobs in the organization. It helps recruiters meeting their own KPIs and fulfilling positions for the employer.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">EDGE Recruit also helps recruiters create and manage this candidate base effectively by auto sourcing. It allows sync with multiple job boards at one place directly so that they never run out of CVs. Of course, they will never run out of talent pool, the entire market available for exploration.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is how we use tech for good.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/recruit\">Book a demo</a>&nbsp;now;&nbsp;allow us to show you how Recruit can be your catalyst for change.</p>","slug":"need-to-hire-immediately-use-your-existing-talent-pool-effectively","subTitle":"Need to fill a position within the shortest time possible?
