{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":534,"title":"EDGE Recruit - The Enabler Of Change & Hirings Of The Future","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Hi, I'm Anannya, and I lead content at EDGE. We are in conversation with Arjun Pratap, CEO, EDGE. We will be discussing the possible future of hiring and how our latest product, EDGE Recruit, is poised to act as a catalyst for change, both for recruiters and organizations alike. Welcome, Arjun.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:&nbsp;</strong>I was in conversation with Dinesh yesterday, where he mentioned that this year, hirings are going to go up, given there was a lot of attrition, lot of job losses last year. And this is in line with the Future of Work 2021 global survey, which says 82% of employers are looking to hire this year. So what is your opinion on this? How do you see the industry now?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Arjun Pratap</strong>: So I mean, hiring has been a perennial focus because everyone's looking at hiring primarily because everyone has attrition when people want to look at change. But hiring is one facet of the problem. And I'm going to focus on that facet, and why hiring continues to be a problem which is a lot to do with the way we hire, which fundamentally, if you look at the statistics, also, when you talk about the future of work and the state of talent acquisition, its various reports are being generated primarily because of the world-changing its way of delivering value or creating value through steady-state businesses, or verticals, as we know it, they're reforming, refactoring to deliver this value to their consumers and to their customers. And hence, the need for people within the business to help them restructure is of paramount importance. This is why I think there are two facets of it, the loss of your job or the job loss side of is one piece of the writing on the wall that we've already read. The other is reinvesting in hiring people, which has become the next mantra because you're trying to figure out now, based on growth, that you visualize how you could get the right people in to deliver the outcomes that you want. So hiring will continue going through the roof. I mean, an economy like the US, which is, I think, investing $6 trillion, and its restructuring and rewiring will see a boom. And that's a signal to the rest of the world because they are the number one in terms of GDP, followed by China, and they are looking at how they can bounce back and deliver this value post-COVID, which are seeing real signs through various facets of the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, I think the answer is that talent acquisition will continue seeing a change because people will figure out how to solve the same problem in different ways. After all, other facets of that one problem will start becoming efficient; some facets will continue to evolve or stay inefficient. And then therein lies the ability to create that opportunity and start tapping into it.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Technology is only going to provide you with a means to an end. And when I say it in a very simplified way, it's automation, data science, analysis, input, information retrieval, etc. These various things will come in and play a part in helping people identify the right talent. So I think that's where talent acquisition is and where I think there's a huge, massive opportunity over the next decade.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;As we discussed before this, Mercer's recent report states that organizations across the spectrum take a very long time to hire. Only 20% hire within a month; the rest take a cycle of almost three months to fulfil a position. Now, if you could elucidate how EDGE Recruit can solve this concern? And how are organizations poised to benefit from it?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong>&nbsp;So, my theory of life is not based on my concept or my perception; it's about being in this domain, understanding hiring the way it understands it from people who are a lot more accomplished in hiring as you mentioned, Dinesh from our company was, you know, in JPMorgan Chase. He understands hiring competencies, talent acquisition, retention very well. And like that, I've met a fair few people within our business, our customer base, to help understand what we bring to the table that changes the game. It's not about searching and matching in AI as we know it; this is the science that comes to mind. It's also about helping people through a process. And that process has to get streamlined. The process has to get efficient. The process has to get very nimble. So, simplification of this process is of paramount importance. And what happens is when users like you and I are also recruiters or working with recruiters based on our needs? We also have to understand that as a user, as a recruiter, I'm used to an Ola, Swiggy, Uber or Netflix, which is very nimble and simplified in its ability to navigate. And that's the same, that's using a B2B application.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, our effort in EDGE Recruit, as with most EDGE products, is to simplify these talent decisions that recruiters are trying to make on behalf of a hiring manager or a candidate who wants to join a company, tap into an opportunity. Making that efficient making that simplification possible through user experience, across different filters that we gave across different stages of the process, is really where it counts. AI will also compound the benefit by learning across the steps of these events and starting to calibrate, re-adjust itself so that the product begins to deliver better results through the heuristics that it picks up in some of the signals that it already has within the system. So, EDGE Recruit is a great product because it's focused on simplification. It's about the user, and the user is the recruiter, in my view, who's going to continue to deliver this value of bringing somebody on board â€“ it is very critical to performing within your organization. That process has to be simple. It's also about delivering that automated, clear, simple set of steps to help the recruiter suddenly move from I'm shortlisting the candidate, I'm screen candidate, I'm going to help schedule an interview, I'm going to help, schedule an assessment, then, you know, start the verification processes or multiple things, and then you're doing it for 50 people. You sort of lose your marbles at the point.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">If this process can be simplified and automated in many ways, the information is available to the recruiter. What happens is that the recruiter starts diving back and giving the candidate a better experience in terms of the onboarding, the journey about understanding the position to lead the outcomes. And that conversation is got a lot more value. So, I think as recruiters focusing on making sure that the dialogue between the recruiter and the candidate is very streamlined and very valuable. So, we have done the other pieces that we could automate and make easy for the recruiter to access.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:&nbsp;</strong>Arjun, there's a lot of AI being used in the hiring industry today or if we could say that organizations and recruiters are moving towards it steadily. People are going digital; organizations are increasing their technology adoption. If I could ask you, what changes will we see shortly with the combination of various technologies and AI being into play? How will it benefit the organization, the recruiter, the employee - everybody in that circle?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong>&nbsp;So, the changes are going to be simplification. It is also about the different niche or point solutions working together. So, the sense of partnership and collaboration is going to be a reality. And partnership and collaboration will then start giving you what we call platform benefits. So, the platform will then start housing different pieces of the puzzle or various parts of the process - from meeting a candidate through their resume or their profile and starting to engage with them as they go through the process. That I think is going to start becoming platformized. What is going to develop future or forward-looking from that is the ecosystem. In an ecosystem, you will have multiple players within the niches that will start defining their set value props, which companies then can pick off depending on what they need for what part of the process and what they deem is fit for them.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It's like the Ambassador and the Fiat? Both are cars. Which one do you like because of the shape, the size etc., is your choice? Likewise, you will want a specific assessment partner, a specific interviewing software, a specific background verification partner, and a specific set of companies you want to hire from a particular interview set to interview in a panel. How would you modulate all of that? If that is simplified, and if that becomes platformized, then what you're doing is navigating the person through that, rendering the recruiter drive more value into being like a concierge service for the candidate to move across into</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">onboarding. And I remember the Ex-CHRO of HCL, Prithvi Shergill, citing that this should be like a concierge service. I think it does make a lot of sense. His vision was to somebody, literally from being identified to being onboarded, have it happened within five hours. Can you actually run that assessment interview process, screening, background verification, and offers rolled out within five hours? It seems euphoric and sort of ideal state, but it also appears believable and doable.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And I think at some point, people have to believe in simplification and compression. I know some of the customers we deal with. Incidentally, HCL is a customer of ours. They have really visionary people sitting there and moving things to define these processes faster and better. We have people in Wipro who are constantly looking at streamlining and making it the most efficient recruitment process. Just giving a few names, but we have close to 500,000 IT services, employees transacted across a platform, and millions going through the recruitment process. So, it's a benefit that we drive. Platformization is one key area of significance. Some people expect our companies to be platformed, as a virtue of them having a SaaS product, but platformization is also about allowing multiple products within a company to be housed in multiple products outside of the company; it also is housed in, and that's really about true platformization. And then the ecosystem where you're starting to look at how you can better be the general community through the ecosystem. And I think those are the stages that we will see talent acquisition move through.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">And in benefiting the candidate, the case, since everything will move, the position will be filled up filled faster. Candidates will be chosen based on merit, without any bias, in the process because some of the focus areas have always been, how do you build in diversity and inclusion? How do you build in sort of an equitable process? How do you be meritocratic? And for that, do you have to take some of the conditioning or the unconscious bias that we have out of our systems and technology today plays a huge part in making it a level playing. And for that, you have to build your AI, right. You have to build your product right. And I think all technology companies are focusing on delivering that value through the product thesis of solving that problem in a genuine sense. And I think companies are benefiting from that. This is why many companies have a change in the ratios that they have a difference in the kind of productivity and impact that these ratios give them, which is an important facet. You are building a company to be productive and delivering value. But the other side of it is, you're also missing out on the fact that the candidate comes in with a lot of promise and how you guide them through the process and how you guide them through the journey of being with you is so important. It's about getting that fitment organized and reorganizing or reshuffling that fitment based on the aspirations of the person and the organization's aspirations, personal success to the organization's success, critical to correct, and my belief that I can see in the products that cater to it. It's not something that's in the making; it's here to deliver value. And I think we're at the forefront of providing value through our product, making kudos to our team who has worked really hard on, you know, setting that targets for globally competitive products and creating this value for the candidate for the recruiter for the company. So we are meeting those sorts of very linear sets of intervention points where it's necessary to solve these problems; otherwise, they are very disconnected. They continue to provide a lot of inefficiency in the system.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;Right. So, what's more, in the sense that, what is the roadmap ahead, for EDGE, for EDGE Recruit and the industry?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong>&nbsp;Yeah, so for the industry, it's about obviously fueling the many companies and the many people who need to meet with companies that are a constant focus. There will be a consumer-focused set of applications; demand focused set of business-to-business applications will continue to be built. It's going to see many that change primarily because the jobs are evolving in the nature of the construct. What kind of skills you require, what kind of competencies you need, what kind of depth you require is still in the air, and it's being fleshed out to start becoming table stakes and understood. That's where companies like us continue to play a part in the definition. Once the definition is real, then the identification happens. And then, the planning is also a part of the process. So we believe that the definition of identification and planning is very vital to the circle of employability and gainful employment.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">It's essential to be in that mix, where you're looking at all the signals across these different industries that require people in various capacities because of the way they see themselves today delivering similar outcomes or the same outcomes. It's just morphed because automation is rife, efficiency has come in, technology has provided changes to the sense of direction, in one sense, or the sense of speed, to achieve production that's already been oriented. So I think for us as a company, we believe that we will go out there and really be the career guide to every individual on the planet. And for that, we are building products that will start first on the simplification level, where talent decisions are being made, where we can help companies across that process, help candidates across our process and support employees across the process. So we have a few products that we've built on a talent decision platform that focuses on the employee, focus on the resource managers, recruiters, workforce planning and forecasting pieces. And it's all focused on the people pillar. And I think that's the area that we believe that as a forward-looking movement, the opportunity to build internal talent, places and opportunity marketplaces and deep platforms exists. And we're going to tap into that because we think there's the value that we can create based on our line of sight in the company.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong>&nbsp;Great.
