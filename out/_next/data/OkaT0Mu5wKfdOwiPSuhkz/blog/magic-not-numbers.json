Let’s take a couple of examples that we can all related to.</p><p>Our company’s attrition rate is 12% for the year 2015. What does this mean? Good or bad? What do we measure it against? What is the industry trend? And more…these questions are some of the comments that are likely to pop up during that conversation. If that statement was qualified by saying it was 8% last year and it has become 12%, or the industry is at 20% and we are at 12%, the trajectory of the discussions become very different.</p><p>Another example is in sales productivity. The average sales productivity was USD 200,000 for the year. While that number sounds great, did that result in us meeting our targets for the year? What was the initial target number and how have we performed? When we say that our sales productivity was USD 200, 000 for the year as against the target of USD 150,000 for the year, it lends a lot of credibility to the statement.</p><p>Numbers are used in many situations to create a case for action. For the case to be strong, it has to be built on a strong foundation, one of representing the context behind the numbers and hence the assertions. In my experience, when you are trying create a case with numbers, keep in mind the following</p><ol><li>Begin with the end in mind – what are you wanting people to be left with</li><li>Present the context before the actual numbers</li><li>Only present the statistics that are relevant to the audience</li><li>Clearly explain, don’t leave anything for assumptions (formulas are not intuitive)</li><li>End with the next steps and how these statistics can be used.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Often we get caught up in the whirlpool of numbers and think they magically reveal something. But guess what…the real magic lies in the presenter and how the numbers are being presented.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kaushik-2-262x300.jpg?resize=262%2C300\" alt=\"Kaushik 2\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kaushik-2.jpg?resize=262%2C300&amp;ssl=1 262w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kaushik-2.jpg?resize=768%2C881&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kaushik-2.jpg?resize=893%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 893w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Kaushik-2.jpg?w=1392&amp;ssl=1 1392w\" sizes=\"100vw\" width=\"262\"></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp; ~Kaushik Gopalan&nbsp;</strong><br><i>Global HR Business Partner – Aspect Software Inc</i></p><h3><i><strong>About the author:</strong></i></h3><p>Kaushik Gopalan is an award-winning senior HR professional &amp; <a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"><strong>training and development specialist</strong></a><strong> </strong>with more than a decade of contributions in top-tier IT organizations.
