Yet, it was found to be financially more suitable to locate efficient workers from within.&nbsp;By up-skilling these internal resources, the need for external hiring dipped for large conglomerates, thereby flattening talent acquisition costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Today, as the world grapples with the deadly&nbsp;<i>Coronavirus</i>&nbsp;outbreak,&nbsp;automation has&nbsp;arrived to pick up the pieces. Companies are automating every single redundant task, to speed up processes and produce results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>HR Tech systems coupled with intelligent tools like AI are helping these enterprises identify future demands, and thus, successfully up-skill the employees to undertake newly evolving roles and job requirements. &nbsp;</p><p>By studying all the skills&nbsp;and skill-sets that are present within the confines of&nbsp;a&nbsp;company, intelligent HR Tech systems can study the&nbsp;pain points&nbsp;associated with skill gaps and make the required recommendations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, when addressing the idea of Workforce Optimisation, we need to understand that it goes beyond the rudimentary conversation surrounding Bench Optimisation and Employee re-skilling. The real conversation surrounds the primary&nbsp;notion: which is automation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Whilst costs are down with regard to Talent Acquisition and successful Internal Mobility practices, organisations all also saving millions by automating roles across the RMG (Resource Management Group) function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By utilising intelligent algorithms to scan, study and&nbsp;allocate employees to right jobs within, the need for larges RMGs with hundreds of executives ceases to be a reality. By reducing the number of excess resources in these RMGs, an organisation can save anywhere between 40,000 – 115,000 USD a year per employee.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another form of optimisation is the integration of HR Tech systems with&nbsp;existent&nbsp;ESS (Employee Self Service) tools.&nbsp;Most employees do not update information pertaining to skills and overall experience gained in real-time. This often makes it difficult for RMGs to accurately search and match resources to right job roles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>By having a dedicated career portal and <a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"><strong>career path tools</strong></a>, employees are encouraged to regularly update their skills and experience, to have greater visibility into the internal talent pool. A career portal helps employees get their careers on track, which has been attributed to the reduction in overall attrition. It has been noted that companies with a dedicated Employee Career portal saw a decline of over 12% in overall attrition rates, with some enterprises reporting numbers as astounding as 40%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Automating the fulfillment pipeline serves as a double entendre: which is to not only reduce the number of resources required within an organization but also as a vessel to help manage talent. With stiff competition on the rise for talent, organizations need to invest more heavily into retaining skilled resources. <a href=\"https://getedge.ai/\"><strong>Getedge </strong></a>can turn them into the workforce of the future for the future of business with the help of technology.</p>","slug":"how-is-workforce-optimisation-helping-enterprises-save-millions-each-year","subTitle":"<p>The average expenditure for hiring and training a new employee can range anywhere between 6,000 – 18,000 USD a year.  One of the most cost-effective practices in an enterprise today is workforce optimisation, because it allows organisations to find the right talent from within.  Organisations around the globe spend millions&#8230;</p>\n","sizeInGrid":4,"meta_description":"Find out how artificial intelligence is helping companies identify future demands, and successfully up-skill the employees to undertake newly evolving roles","metaDesc":null,"published_at":"2021-02-23T18:29:32.698Z","created_at":"2021-02-23T18:29:24.603Z","updated_at":"2021-04-21T05:23:25.861Z","featuredImage":{"id":513,"name":"Blog-Banner-16.jpg","alternativeText":null,"caption":null,"width":1880,"height":1253,"formats":{"thumbnail":{"name":"thumbnail_Blog-Banner-16.jpg","hash":"thumbnail_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":234,"height":156,"size":10.64,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/thumbnail_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620.jpg"},"large":{"name":"large_Blog-Banner-16.jpg","hash":"large_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":1000,"height":666,"size":101.03,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/large_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620.jpg"},"medium":{"name":"medium_Blog-Banner-16.jpg","hash":"medium_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":750,"height":500,"size":65.89,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/medium_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620.jpg"},"small":{"name":"small_Blog-Banner-16.jpg","hash":"small_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","width":500,"height":333,"size":36.12,"path":null,"url":"/uploads/small_Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620.jpg"}},"hash":"Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620","ext":".jpg","mime":"image/jpeg","size":256.02,"url":"/uploads/Blog_Banner_16_af6de0a620.jpg","previewUrl":null,"provider":"local","provider_metadata":null,"created_at":"2021-02-23T18:29:31.090Z","updated_at":"2021-02-23T18:29:31.115Z"},"categories":[{"id":1,"Name":"Industry News","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.560Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:13.950Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:23.593Z"},{"id":2,"Name":"Expert Speak","published_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.494Z","created_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:32.816Z","updated_at":"2021-02-22T04:47:34.527Z"}]},"setting":{"id":1,"onScroll":false,"timeBound":true,"seconds":"15","userLeaving":false,"published_at":"2021-09-06T05:20:57.164Z","created_at":"2021-09-06T05:18:56.571Z","updated_at":"2021-10-25T05:51:58.729Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
