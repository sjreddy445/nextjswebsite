These tools can streamline the entire recruitment process – right from posting the job requirement right up to selecting the candidate.</p>\n<p>With an additional layer of Artificial Intelligence, recruitment software tools can supercharge your recruitment process. AI-based recruitment tools can help you pin-point the right match for the job opening by scouring through thousands of resumes – in a matter of minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://edgenetworks.in/2017/10/26/edge-networks-optimizes-recruitment-ai/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI-based recruitment tools have transformed the recruitment process</a> by reducing the human-dependency and the human bias that came along-with. Additionally this eliminates the need to manually check resumes and select candidates.</p>\n<h3>Best practice #2: Employee referral programs</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-8690\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-referral-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=550%2C220&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"220\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-referral-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-referral-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=300%2C120&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>One of the most productive ways to find top talent is implementing a structured <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/72/how-employee-referral-programs-can-improve-time-cost-and-quality-of-hire\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">employee referral program</a>. Employee referrals can improve the quality, time and cost per hire. According to LinkedIn’s <a href=\"https://business.linkedin.com/content/dam/me/business/en-us/talent-solutions/resources/pdfs/linkedin-global-recruiting-trends-report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>, employee referrals are a top source of quality hires, Another research conducted by HR Technologist has found that referred candidates are 55% faster to hire.</p>\n<p>Employee referral programs enable you to turn your existing employees into recruiters. Setting up a structured employee referral program is a great way to leverage your employees’ social networks. They probably know a lot of people from your industry (and beyond), so ask them to help you spread the word about your open job positions and recommend potential candidates.</p>\n<p>Make sure you show your appreciation for the time and enthusiasm they invested in helping you find potential candidates. Reward employees who submit referrals with a bonus, day off or similar perk. You can also gamify your employee referral process by turning in into a competition or a sourcing “jam” with snacks and drinks.</p>\n<h3>Best practice #3: Social media recruiting</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8693\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-recruiting-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.png?resize=605%2C256&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"605\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-recruiting-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.png?w=605&amp;ssl=1 605w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/social-media-recruiting-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.png?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>The chances are that your top candidates aren’t looking for a job and visiting job boards. This is where <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/115/social-media-recruiting-how-to-promote-employer-brand-on-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">social media recruiting</a> comes in. You can use social media to find, attract and hire top candidates.</p>\n<p>First of all, post your jobs on your company’s social media profiles such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Then, ask your employees to share your job posts in order to reach a wider audience. This is a very effective way to spread the word about your open job positions quickly and easily.</p>\n<p>Another way to find great candidates on social media is by joining different social media professional communities. For example, you can join different professional groups on Facebook or search for an industry or job-related hashtags on Twitter. That way, you will be able to tap into a wide pool of great potential candidates!</p>\n<h3>Best practice #4: Recruiting events</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-8692\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recruitment-events-find-top-talent.jpg?resize=1024%2C592&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"592\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recruitment-events-find-top-talent.jpg?resize=1024%2C592&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recruitment-events-find-top-talent.jpg?resize=300%2C173&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recruitment-events-find-top-talent.jpg?resize=768%2C444&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/recruitment-events-find-top-talent.jpg?w=2120&amp;ssl=1 2120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>You are probably familiar with a typical recruiting events such as job fairs and career fairs. Such events are great if you’re looking for active job seekers. Unfortunately, top talent can rarely be found on these types of events.</p>\n<p>If you want to find top candidates, you should attend industry conferences, panels, and workshops. This type of event is a great opportunity to discover potential job candidates and connect with them in an informal, networking manner.</p>\n<p>Don’t rely just on attending different events &#8211; organize your own! Hosting workshops, mixers, meet-ups, or happy hours for professionals in a particular field is a great way to attract top talent’s attention and make them come to you!</p>\n<h3>Best practice #5: Talent optimization</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8694\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/talent-optimization-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=800%2C450&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/talent-optimization-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/talent-optimization-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/talent-optimization-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>Talent optimization is another simple but often overlooked method for finding top talent. Talent optimization is the practice of tapping into your pool of internal employees and upskilling them to fit the requirement.</p>\n<p>When trying to fill an open job position, you should first revaluate your internal employee database. You should pay special attention to candidates who have skills similar to the requirement. Missing skills can be improved using L&amp;D processes. Some of them may be a perfect fit for your current job opening!</p>\n<p>Talent optimization is a great way to capitalize on the time and money you already invested in hiring for other roles. Since you probably have a list of great, already vetted and tested previous candidates, talent optimization is one of the most cost-effective and quickest ways to source for new roles.</p>\n<h3>Best practice #6: Job advertisements</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8691\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/job-advertisements-find-top-talent-edgenetworks.jpg?resize=300%2C209&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"209\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to find top talent, consider looking into the best practices of the job advertisements.<br />\nFirst of all, you should write a great job posting. Don’t post typical job descriptions with a list of the job requirements and qualifications. This is not a good way to find top candidates.</p>\n<p>Instead, think like a marketer and find a way to sell your job. Put yourself in your candidates’ shoes and look at your job posting from their perspective. Let them know what is in for them if they accept your job. Emphasize your competitive salary, company culture, interesting projects, unique benefits and perks you offer, etc.</p>\n<p>Finally, improve your advertising practices to reach a wider audience. Do you always post on the same job board? Experiment with a few different job boards. Take advantage of free job posting sites as well. You can also post your jobs on your company’s website and feature it in your company’s newsletter.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion: Proactively look for talent</h2>\n<p>The old “post and pray” method doesn’t work anymore. You can’t simply post your job opening on a major job board and expect top talent to come knocking on your door. If you want to hire the best candidates, you’ll need to implement new, proactive hiring strategies.</p>\n<p>Some of the best proactive practices for finding high-quality candidates include picking the perfect recruitment software tools, advanced job advertisement practices, implementing a structured employee referral program, attending and organizing networking event, social media recruiting and talent optimization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Author:</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-8696 alignleft\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Anja_Zojceska_TalentLyft_photo.png?resize=148%2C129&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"148\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Anja_Zojceska_TalentLyft_photo.png?w=504&amp;ssl=1 504w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Anja_Zojceska_TalentLyft_photo.png?resize=300%2C261&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 148px) 100vw, 148px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><strong>Anja Zojčeska</strong> is an HR enthusiast and a Content Marketing Specialist at the recruitment software company <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TalentLyft</a>.
