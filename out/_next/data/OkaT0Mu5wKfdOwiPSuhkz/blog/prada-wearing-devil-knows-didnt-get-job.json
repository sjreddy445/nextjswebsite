Hunting for jobs, sending resumes, waiting for weeks and not getting a reply. How many times have you sat in a quiet corner eating ice cream and wondered what went wrong? I mean, you were perfect for the job!</p>\n<p>What if we tell you that there is a fair chance that your resume did not even reach human hands? What if an automated system just scanned it and sent it straight to the virtual shredder? Sad, but it is true.</p>\n<p>Hiring is just not the same anymore and is evolving as HR Technology continues to innovate. Most recruiters now rely on different tools that perform tasks like filtering resumes by scanning it for keywords and key phrases. Some of these smart tools can also go on to mathematically score the resumes and send them for human review. Voila! Human effort is down by 50%.</p>\n<p>But while you sit and sob about your lack of employability, the poor system goes through a lot. So much so, if it were to be a person, it would definitely be Hollywood’s favourite devil, Miranda Priestly- fierce, honest and on top of it’s game.<br />\nSo, let Miranda tell you why you didn’t get a call back with some of her most iconic quotes. Caution: She doesn’t like to mince her words.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4866 alignnone\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.jpg?resize=444%2C188&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"1\" width=\"444\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.jpg?resize=300%2C127&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image source: <a href=\"https://in.pinterest.com/pin/5348093280112312/\">https://in.pinterest.com/pin/5348093280112312/</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Who is that sad little person?</strong></p>\n<p>Though they are getting better at it, HR tools aren’t that great at reading PDFs. So, if you send across your resume as a PDF, chances are that the system won’t recognise you. Try and send your cv in rich text or word format to be easily recognisable.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: Delete any extra logos, symbols or pictures. Use a simple font like Arial or Times New Roman- Technology requires simplicity.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4873\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2.jpg?resize=446%2C180&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2\" width=\"446\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2.jpg?resize=300%2C121&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 446px) 100vw, 446px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image source: <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/\">https://www.buzzfeed.com/</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>No, no, get away from her, she’s useless and unattractive</strong></p>\n<p>Uh oh! Atleast that’s what it will say if your resume doesn’t highlight the right keywords for the system to track. Include words and phrases mentioned in the job description in your resume to make sure you match. While using acronyms, also make sure that you use the spelled out form. For example- Use Chartered Accountant as well as CA.</p>\n<p><strong>Quick tip</strong>: Don’t go overboard by stuffing your CV with keywords. HR Tech tools are smarter than you’d ever imagine and can easily detect keyword stuffing.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-4876\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3.jpg?resize=445%2C178&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"3\" width=\"445\" height=\"178\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3.jpg?resize=300%2C120&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/3.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image source: <a href=\"http://instantreplay.tumblr.com/post/19271605482\">http://instantreplay.tumblr.com/post/19271605482</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Details of your incompetence do not interest me</strong></p>\n<p>Well, we wouldn’t call it incompetence but a boring boiler plate is definitely a waste of space. It won’t impress the interviewer and it is definitely of no use to the keyword scanning system. Try and ditch the career objective section and include 5-6 points bullet about your core skills. This will not only help the system score you better, but also provide a quick overview about your skills to the recruiter.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-4878\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4.jpg?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"4\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/4.jpg?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><br />\n<span style=\"font-size: 12px;\">Image source: <a href=\"http://groupthink.kinja.com/\">groupthink.kinja.com</a></span></p>\n<p><strong>Am I reaching for the stars here? Not really</strong></p>\n<p>Correctly spelt words aren’t too much to ask for, right? Spelling mistakes could mean the death of your resume. In simple words, the automated system wouldn’t catch incorrectly spelt words and wouldn’t understand what your resume wants to say. Run a quick spell check on your document to make sure there are no typos.</p>\n<p>Keeping these simple things in mind will help you get past the technology barrier but that does not mean you’ll get the job. Recruiting is a complex procedure and recruiters pay attention to even the most minute details. Here’s how you can make your CV even more appealing.</p>\n<p><strong>Quantify your impact</strong></p>\n<p>Numbers attract attention. It’s an easy way to stand out.<br />\nExample:</p>\n<p><strong>Weak:</strong> Managed an international concert</p>\n<p><strong>Strong:</strong> Managed $50,000 international concert with a footfall of 5000 people</p>\n<p><strong>Don’t be shy to mention the big brands.</strong> It will immediately catch the recruiter’s attention</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><strong>Weak:</strong> Designed a mentorship program for 6 students</p>\n<p><strong>Strong:</strong> Designed a mentorship program for 6 students from Yale and Harvard.</p>\n<p><strong>Make your interests as quirky as possible</strong></p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<p><strong>Weak:</strong> movies, music, travelling</p>\n<p><strong>Strong:</strong> Tarantino movies, EDM music, trekking in the Himalayas</p>\n<p>We really hope this piece helped you find some answers.
