In a survey by Jibe and Kelton Global, which polled more than 1,000 job seekers, found 3 of 5 respondents said job applications are more difficult to fill out than other common applications, such as those required for a mortgage, student loan or health insurance. The question is why is so much info required right away?</p><p>To succeed, organizations need to make their hiring process simpler. Knowing what we know about the talent war, the area of recruitment needs creative re-imagination; to develop recruitment models that truly ‘connect’ with Talent.</p><p>Design Thinking, a user-centered interdisciplinary method for innovation, can help enable such a model. Simply put, Design Thinking is about: How do you keep the person you’re serving at the center of everything you do?</p><p><strong>Let’s hold onto Design Thinking</strong></p><p>To get the hold of Design Thinking, the first requirement is a change in mindset to be a solution provider, to focus on the experience rather than the process. For this, one of the first things recruiters must do is to reimagine the process, talk to those who are part of the process, find out what their experience was, listen and observe with an open mind – what you will get to understand is the real need.</p><p>Then go onto develop a solution that is simple for the end-user – the potential employee and the hiring manager. The product will improve productivity, be enjoyable to use, fit into the overall corporate agenda, and support business growth. A product or solution such as this will require you to question traditions, manage change and discover improvements that can be made.</p><p><strong>5 Simple Steps to Recruitment via Design Thinking</strong></p><p>#1. Make the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Gxmozp\">process user-centered</a> with focus on hiring the right skill rather than the right qualification. Start with understanding the experience of the existing stakeholders and end with renovating the experience in such a way that it is a pleasurable one.</p><p>#2. Adopt a collaborative approach (move away from working in silos, to more sharing, partnering and cooperation) to overall talent management with hiring as an integral part of the HR value chain.</p><p>#3. Redefine the JD creation process to incorporate Talent Personas – what is required to do a job well. Enhance this with an assessment that is robust with a combination of assessment methods.</p><p>#4. Measure and improve. Use analytics to understand the status quo, make necessary changes and measure again to understand the true value of the change.</p><p>#5. Take an outside-in view by mirroring the CRM program to talent management. Build relationships with existing employees and develop relationships with potential employees to create a sustainable talent supply.</p><p>Josh Bersin at Deloitte predicts HR teams in 2017 will stop designing “programs” and instead design integrated, high-value “experiences” that excite, engage and inspire employees. Design thinking is a scientific, disciplined method of problem-solving – finding the method in the madness or the hay in the needlestack. It provides an opportunity for HR to reshape how it works with the organization and to redesign its own processes to ensure positive employee interactions and more engaged employees.</p><p><i>If you enjoyed the article, please leave us a comment and we will get back to you.</i></p>","slug":"put-smile-applicants-face-simple-ways-hire-better","subTitle":"<p>How many times have we started filling out a job application form and left it mid way because of the convoluted and time-consuming process.
