Subsequent personalization campaigns can encompass an extensive area of online and offline media, including: web site optimization, segmentation, email marketing, merchandising and promoted messages.</p><p>Often retailers who have been successful in offering personalized interactions have built their strategies on the back of robust predictive analytics technology. Some have tried to meld their brick-and-mortar operations with faster-growing e-commerce operations.</p><p>An example would be a clothing retail brand which successfully harnessed analytics so that shoppers are provided with personalized style recommendations, consultants, in-house stylists and style recommendation apps, all under one roof.</p><h3><strong>Diving into data</strong></h3><p>Joining forces with solution providers to establish personalization strategies, retailers are focusing on collecting and analyzing customer data.
