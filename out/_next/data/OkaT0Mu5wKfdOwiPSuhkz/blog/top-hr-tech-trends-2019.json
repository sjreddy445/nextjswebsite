In this blog post, we will take a look at the top 10 HR technology trends that will dominate 2019. Learn about the latest exciting tech trends and how they will transform HR in 2019.</p>\n<h4>New technologies: Key to attracting and retaining talent</h4>\n<p>With organizations trying to navigate the shifting industry landscape, <strong>talent </strong>has become a notable <strong>concern</strong>. Companies are competing to <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/211/8-recruitment-strategies-to-attract-the-best-talent\"><strong>attract the best talent </strong></a>and <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/188/9-tips-for-keeping-your-best-employees\"><strong>keep the best employees</strong></a> in an increasingly <strong>competitive </strong>labor market with widening<strong> skill gaps. </strong></p>\n<p>To solve this, the HR industry is looking up to <strong>technology </strong>to be the <strong>savior</strong>. As such, it is of very little surprise that the HR Tech industry is witnessing the <strong>most disruptive periods</strong> it has seen in this decade.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">HR tech trends in 2018</h4>\n<p>Eyeing the potential for the <strong>next big thing</strong> in breakthrough technology, <strong>investors </strong>have pushed as much as much as<strong> $3.1 billion investment </strong>in 2018 alone (and 2018 is not even over yet). In fact, Q3 2018 alone saw <strong>over $1.1 billion</strong>, which is more than the total VC investment seen in 2017.</p>\n<p>We’ve witnessed<a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/142/6-tech-trends-in-hr-that-have-reshaped-recruiting-in-2018\"><strong> tech trends in HR that have reshaped recruiting in 2018</strong></a>. With 2019 just a few weeks away, let us see<strong> what the trends indicate about the future of HR Tech in 2019</strong>.</p>\n<h4>What are the top HR tech trends for 2019?</h4>\n<p>Here is the list of the<strong> top 10 HR tech trends </strong>that will transform the HR industry in 2019:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-8598 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vDZhgbE9KE6w5B8TNJqcSQ.png?resize=700%2C396&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vDZhgbE9KE6w5B8TNJqcSQ.png?w=700&amp;ssl=1 700w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/vDZhgbE9KE6w5B8TNJqcSQ.png?resize=300%2C170&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">HR tech trend #1: Robotic process automation</h4>\n<p>While Artificial Intelligence has managed to automate the Talent Acquisition process, <strong>Robotic Process Automation</strong> aims to transform the <strong>manual </strong>processes involving the HR department.</p>\n<p>The robotic process automation (or RPA technology) is looking to <strong>compress</strong><strong> time-consuming</strong> processes like <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/182/guide-how-to-successfully-onboard-new-employees\">employee onboarding</a>, so that new employees can spend more time on the job function than with the HR department.</p>\n<p>RPA technology is targeting at the 93 percent of HR executives<strong> time repetitive tasks </strong>like creating a new employee record in the employee database, gathering employee documentation and adding a new employee in the payroll system.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #2: HR analytics</h4>\n<p><strong>Data </strong>has attained marked <strong>significance </strong>in the last few years. HR Tech will <strong>completely </strong>transform the HR role into a <strong>data-driven function</strong>. This applies to everything right from hiring candidates by leveraging <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/233/talent-acquisition-analytics-what-it-is-why-it-matters\"><strong>talent acquisition analytics</strong></a> to giving promotions and from employee management to employee performance.</p>\n<p>HR Tech aims to improve company <strong>productivity </strong>by studying data about existing and potential employees. Analytics models help company unearth important <strong>metrics </strong>related to employee performance. Using analytics companies can <strong>predict employee retentio</strong>n, identify employee job changes that are likely to result in high-performance outcomes and recommend the necessary <strong>training </strong>for employees to close the skill gaps.</p>\n<p>However, the <strong>validity </strong>of the predictions from the analytic models is completely <strong>dependent </strong>on the <strong>data </strong>that it is fed with. Moreover, organizations will require resource people to <strong>understand </strong>these models and apply them effectively.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">HR tech trend #3: Workforce planning and optimization</h4>\n<p>Given the indications that we have seen in 2018, we can safely assume that 2019 will be the year with a <strong>renewed focus</strong> on recruiting from <strong>within </strong>thereby increasing retention rates. Companies will depend on HR Tech solutions to <strong>forecas</strong><strong>t the workforce demand, <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/242/hr-metrics-how-and-why-to-calculate-employee-turnover-rate\">calculate the employee turnover rate</a>and even predict attrition. </strong></p>\n<p>Companies are putting in a lot of effort to <strong>properly plan</strong> their workforce as constituting skills which can help them to quickly respond to business needs. Also <strong>forecasting the requirements</strong> for future requirements is playing an essential role in increasing the utilization of employees.</p>\n<p>Further, there is an expected increase in the <strong>bench utilization</strong> as most of the resources on the bench will be matched to existing demands internally, thereby reducing the dependency on external recruitment.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #4: Talent management</h4>\n<p>Companies are increasingly realizing the value of a <strong>people-first approach</strong> to business. This has resulted in not just <strong>investment </strong>in good talent, but active support for both the personal and professional <strong>development </strong>of their employees.</p>\n<p>Companies are using HR Tech to provide <strong>clarity </strong>to employees on how their contributions <strong>impact </strong>the business. This results in <strong>memorable </strong>employee experiences that drive recruiting and retention.</p>\n<p>However, the most important change that is expected in this domain is that of <strong>performance </strong><strong>ratings</strong>. The age-old process is expected to be completely replaced by dynamic goal setting, <strong>continuous </strong>performance check-ins, and crowdsourced feedback. Using HR Tech, employers will be more active in pushing accountability down to the employees, valuing <strong>conversation </strong>over documentation, measuring iterative progress.</p>\n<p>This level of employee <strong>engagement </strong>along with data analytics will help organizations access gaps to future-proof the workforce. This transition into a digital workforce is expected to aid in <strong>solving the retention problem. </strong></p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #5: Learning and development</h4>\n<p>In a bid to create a digital workforce, L&amp;D will receive a huge boost. <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/191/its-time-to-make-employee-training-digital\"><strong>Employee training will be made digital</strong></a> and technology will change the way employees <strong>immerse </strong>themselves with L&amp;D using AI and AR/VR solutions.</p>\n<p>While L&amp;D is conventionally concerned with skills required on the job, several new initiatives offer it externally to candidates that identify themselves with interest in a career path, thereby helping companies <strong>identify and assess </strong>which candidates are committed to the path.</p>\n<p>Also moving away from primary core competencies, companies are now also<strong> developing their employees&#8217; soft skills</strong>, such as emotional intelligence, collaboration, and negotiation.</p>\n<p>Moreover, with a <strong>gamified </strong>L&amp;D system, companies are trying to incentivize the online training experience for even the most jaded learner using badges, points, leaderboards and community involvement.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #6: Payroll management</h4>\n<p>Technology will continue to have a huge impact on <strong>payroll management</strong>. Basic calculations and processes like tax deduction and benefits will be completely <strong>automated</strong>, leaving no room for error.</p>\n<p>Also, the transition to <strong>cloud-based services</strong> makes payroll management for organizations spread across the globe, making it <strong>universal </strong>managed while being processed locally.</p>\n<p>There is more focus on deeper <strong>integration </strong>with the HCM systems offering a<strong> two-way communication</strong> between the systems. When managed correctly, HCM integration will enable organizations to achieve a <strong>global </strong>perspective on the workforce with the <strong>security </strong>of local compliance.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #7: Recruiting experiences</h4>\n<p><strong>Talent Acquisition </strong>has seen a lot of disruption over the last few months. However, with technology, it is now being perceived as an <strong>experience</strong>. This year will see candidate participating in a fully <strong>immersive </strong>experience that is a blend of current onboarding practices and <strong>virtual</strong>, illusory experiences.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/88/what-is-full-life-cycle-recruiting\">entire recruitment lifecycle</a> will be transformed <strong>digitally</strong>. Everything right from resumes to interviews is set to be <strong>digitized </strong>using technology. This will ensure that the candidates have a<strong> <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/86/recruiting-hacks-improve-candidate-experience-in-10-simple-steps\">seamless candidate experience</a>.</strong></p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #8: Recruitment marketing</h4>\n<p>This will be the year that the HR department will focus on implementing <strong>marketing tactics</strong> for recruiting. This includes <strong>nurturing and attracting</strong>talented individuals to the organization. This is expected to be the answer to the <strong>talent crunch</strong> that the industry is currently experiencing.</p>\n<p>An important aspect of this would include <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/resources/what-is-employer-branding\"><strong>Employer Branding</strong></a><strong> </strong>&#8211; the organization&#8217;s reputation and popularity as an employer, and its employee value proposition.</p>\n<p>With research indicating that<strong> 75% of job seekers research about a company&#8217;s reputation</strong> and employer brand before applying, this is becoming the need of the hour for HR departments.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-8602\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Image3.png?resize=768%2C394&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"394\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Image3.png?w=768&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Image3.png?resize=300%2C154&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p>HR departments are also leveraging <strong>Social Media</strong> like never before.<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/resources/what-is-social-recruiting\"><strong>Social recruiting</strong></a> means more than just<a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/115/social-media-recruiting-how-to-promote-employer-brand-on-social-media\"><strong> promoting your employer brand on the traditional Social Media</strong></a> channels like LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter.</p>\n<p>Blogs, forums, job boards and <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/137/how-to-enhance-your-employer-brand-using-company-review-sites\"><strong>company review sites are also being used to enhance the company’s employer brand</strong></a>.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #9: Remote workforce</h4>\n<p>Technology has been a key enabler for organizations to spread out globally using a <strong>remote </strong>workforce. This has drastically reduced the infrastructure <strong>costs </strong>and has helped access otherwise <strong>inaccessible </strong>talent.</p>\n<p>This trend is only going to <strong>keep </strong>picking up. At the current rate, remote platforms will become <strong>preferable </strong>to face-to-face communication, owing to the <strong>additional </strong>capabilities they provide.</p>\n<p>While studies already indicate that technology is useful in<a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/235/5-tips-to-ensure-your-remote-employees-are-productive\"><strong> ensuring the productivity of remote workers</strong></a>, AI will help manage remote staff in a more <strong>organized </strong>manner helping them <strong>prioritize </strong>their workload and offer instant <strong>feedback</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, replacing video conferencing with<strong> VR conferencing </strong>will make communications more real.</p>\n<h4>HR tech trend #10: Employee wellness</h4>\n<p><strong>Wellness</strong> traditionally meant attending to the <strong>health of employees</strong> via step programs, exercise plans, and better eating habits. However, with the <strong>evolution </strong>of HR Tech, employers are putting added focus on addressing the <strong>emotional, physical, financial and professional needs </strong>of employees.</p>\n<p>Using the<strong> data from software</strong> platforms, wearable, and other data sources, <a href=\"https://www.talentlyft.com/en/blog/article/121/guide-for-hr-professionals-how-to-avoid-burnout-and-retain-your-employees\"><strong>HR professionals are now able to avoid burnout and retain employees</strong></a>.
