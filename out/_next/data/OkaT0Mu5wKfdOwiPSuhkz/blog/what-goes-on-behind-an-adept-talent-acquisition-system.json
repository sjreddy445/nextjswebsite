{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":533,"title":"What Goes On Behind An Adept Talent Acquisition System?","content":"<p>Talent acquisition without a talent acquisition system is like getting into deep waters without a lifejacket. It entails a gamut of exercises from shortlisting applicants to screening them, assessing to final onboarding. While&nbsp;recruiters strife for the best, leaving no stone unturned to find the best possible candidates, their inability to assimilate the latter's updated information, just-in-time insights, time to join, salary expectations etc., at one place and then matching them with open positions makes the task extremely tedious. Resultantly, a&nbsp;talent acquisition manager&nbsp;takes, on average, 60 days to fill a position.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">So, what is the solution? What can recruiters do to fill this gap?</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Well, they need an adept talent acquisition system that can take over their mundane tasks, giving them scope to perform core functionalities. It should ideally be an intelligent system that integrates multiple applications and platforms that make the task of hiring simplified and effortless.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is where EDGE Recruit comes in. Our latest innovation isn't merely a system of workflow but a system of intelligence. The brain behind EDGE Recruit is our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">From collaborative hiring to storing an employee's holistic profile, EDGE Recruit - our AI-enabled product, possesses the capability to parse through a gamut of profiles within few seconds. It then provides you with instant and accurate matches for a job description based on criteria like skillsets, diversity, or location while tackling unintentional and unconscious bias. Recruiters can also search for candidates based on time and cost sensitivities enabling improved conversion rates.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">EDGE Recruit also possesses the ability to source from multiple job boards. Basically, organizations have their repository of different resumes that they have collected over the course of the period, either through career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves, which were never maintained. However, when there is a job in hand, all the talent acquisition manager is trying to do is find the candidates who can fulfil this position. There are multiple sources through which they scout for resumes, the first being their internal talent pool. At most times, it is either incomplete or possesses redundant information. Thus, they go to multiple job boards for the same. EDGE Recruit solves the talent managers woes by auto sourcing candidates from job boards directly so that they never run out of CVs, giving them an entire market to explore through. The product can be used for reverse matching as well, where a single resume can be matched to different job positions within an organization.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Our technology aims to enrich the recruiter's end-to-end experience - from sourcing to interview scheduling, qualitative feedback collection from assessment partners to final onboarding. Simply put, it is an employee-centric solution helping organizations focus on their long-term business goals by putting the talent at the nucleus. And this is precisely what an adept talent acquisition system is supposed to do.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p>It is interesting to note that the Global Digital Talent Acquisition Market is expected to grow from $22,791.04 Million in 2020 to $33,498.78 Million by the end of 2025.&nbsp;Though it poses stiff competition, products that focus on agility of workflow and workforce are sure to end as winners.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">EDGE Recruit ensures recruiters are able to accomplish more in less time, adding value to the organization. It also enables talent managers to get ahead of the competition by onboarding the right mix of people &amp; make better hiring decisions.
