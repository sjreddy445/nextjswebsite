{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":531,"title":"The Issues In Hiring Right!","content":"<p style=\"text-align:justify;\">If the latest figures from the Future of Work 2021 Global Outlook report are believed, then the hiring industry, post the pandemic, is in for stable growth. According to the survey, more than 82% of employers are planning to hire in 2021. Of these, 37% plan to re-hire to backfill jobs and 35% plan to hire new positions. In this context, it is crucial for talent acquisition managers to steadily gear up for future recruitments.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">However, is it as easy as it sounds?&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">At the onset, hiring may look like a piece of cake, but the reality is far from this. On average, a recruiter receives 300 CVs for a single position. And they are looking at multiple posts at one time, which means they are scouting 100s of CVs daily from numerous job portals, making notes tirelessly to match them with the job requirements in hand, shortlisting candidates, contacting them, scheduling interviews, working on feedback, and onboarding them: all at the same time.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>The problem</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">1. Analyzing scores of applicants from various job portals, recruitment agencies etc.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going through each one of them tirelessly, jotting down the skill sets and matching them with the job requirements.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Connecting with shortlisted candidates, screening them, checking the availability of all parties, scheduling interviews</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Post-interview feedback from managers &amp; department heads&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">5.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Generating the offer letter &amp; rolling them out to the candidates</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">6.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maintain a log containing all these details and regularly follow up on status and intent. Thereafter, assisting the candidate until onboarded</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Dinesh Menon, Head of Operations, EDGE, says, \"a recruiter spends most of his time sourcing and sharing. And because of this today, if you really look at it, many recruiters are not doing a recruiters job because they are just busy getting a CV, running it through the TA team and pushing it across. They aren't really doing the interview process, which they're hired for. So what is the recruiter's job, what is the value a recruiter brings? It is to really interview a person, understand the candidate's profile, understand what he or she knows, what the job requires, see a match in terms of the fitment in terms of behaviour, or skill sets, in terms of culture fit, and so on, so forth.\"</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\"><strong>The solution</strong></p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">Lack of astute and intelligent mechanism act as a detriment to logical hiring. Most functions are manually processed, taking a considerable time out of the talent managers' board, leaving them no time to focus on other vital pursuits. The need of the hour is a product that provides a holistic approach giving an instant 360-degree hawk eye view of a candidateâ€™s skill sets, across platforms, at one place, that can be matched to those required for a position.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">EDGE Recruit, our latest innovation, is integrated with multiple applications and platforms that make the task of hiring simplified and effortless. The brain behind EDGE Recruit is our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">From collaborative hiring to storing an employee's profile, our product EDGE Recruit can parse through a gamut of profiles within few seconds to provide instant and accurate matches for a job description based on criteria like skillsets, diversity or location, tackling unintentional and unconscious bias.

Additionally, they can now save about 30% of their total recruitment time by identifying the right people for the right job by reducing knowledge gaps.</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;</p><p style=\"text-align:justify;\">\"Once the right person is identified with the help of EDGE Recruit, it's about going into the next stages of the hiring.
