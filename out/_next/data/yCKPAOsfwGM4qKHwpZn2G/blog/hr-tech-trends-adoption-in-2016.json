But, the lack of analytics-related competencies such as defining the frameworks, interpreting data, identifying predictive relationships persists in most HR departments. We should expect to soon see HCM systems guide users as to where to look for relationships across their data ecosystem. For example like HCM systems, the<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/mobility\">AI talent acquisition and management tool</a> are one of the long-shot trends that will soon be ruling the talent acquisition departments in near future.<br>An increase in the employee turnover might have the system highlight factors that have contributed to higher turnover in the past; for example, a change in compensation or benefits, cutting back on management training, retirement or even restructuring activities that should perhaps not be counted as regular turnover, using less effective sourcing channels or more aggressive time-to-fill target metrics and so on.</p><h3>• <strong>Personalized Engagement and Retention Plans</strong></h3><p>With three generations working side-by-side at workplaces for the first time, it is more critical than ever to personalize how employees are managed and through what rewards and recognition levers. Basically to the extent of having personalized engagement and retention plans for all key employees and including what each employee values in his/her work experience and career journey over time.</p><p>In addition, personality tests and team culture or compatibility indicators, might soon become staples within enterprise HCM solutions going forward. Letting a high-potential employee be exposed to different parts of the business might cost almost zero, but, in the end, could be a more effective engagement driver and retention hook than a larger bonus for many.</p><p><a href=\"https://getedge.ai/\"><i><strong>GetEdge</strong></i></a><i> would love to know your thoughts on this post, please leave a comment and we’d love to have a conversation.</i></p>","slug":"hr-tech-trends-adoption-in-2016","subTitle":"<p>In the HR technology domain, some trends take longer to be adopted than others, even when the expected business impact of both are comparable.
