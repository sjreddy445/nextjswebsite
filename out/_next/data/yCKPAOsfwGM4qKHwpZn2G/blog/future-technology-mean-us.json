The excitement was running high and expectations soaring even higher as the largest and most important event of the year for GPU developers got underway. The GTC is all about current and future technologies that will gradually but powerfully transform the world around us. It’s a must-attend event for developers, data scientists and anyone working in the domains of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), analytics, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, life sciences and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"mailto:https://www.inc.com/molly-reynolds/2017-is-the-year-of-artificial-intelligence.html\">2017 has been rightly termed as the year of Artificial Intelligence</a>. It is one of the most potent forces that will drive the fourth industrial revolution, and is also one of the key focus areas at this year’s GTC.  Honestly, it’s so fascinating to see some of the disruptive innovations that a few early stage companies and startups here are presenting. The event promises to showcase the most amazing work happening in the computer industry today, including fields like deep learning and AI, big data analytics, self-driving cars and more.</p>\n<p>Some of these breakthroughs in deep learning will be game changers with the potential to touch and change our lives in many ways.</p>\n<p>EdGE Networks, a company I founded five years ago in Bangalore, India, is an AI and Data Science driven HR Tech firm. At EdGE, many of our innovations in AI-based recruitment and workforce optimization solutions are powered by NVIDIA’s cutting-edge GPU technology.</p>\n<p>Our key strength lies in harnessing big data, using RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) on high-end GPUs combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) to solve the toughest talent acquisition and workforce optimization challenges faced by some of the world’s largest organizations today. Using advanced analytics algorithms with predictive capabilities, we empower HR leaders with real-time data and actionable insights.</p>\n<p>At GTC 2017, my team and I are excited to witness how other startups are using NVIDIA GPUs to drive innovations in their industries. And share our story about how we are changing workforces.</p>\n<p>Do visit our booth #1018 at GTC 2017 to talk to us and know more about our offerings and innovation.</p>\n<p><em><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-5619 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arjun-Pratap-_CEO-EdGE-Networks-1.jpg?resize=188%2C188&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Arjun Pratap _CEO EdGE Networks\" width=\"188\" height=\"188\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arjun-Pratap-_CEO-EdGE-Networks-1.jpg?resize=300%2C300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arjun-Pratap-_CEO-EdGE-Networks-1.jpg?resize=150%2C150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arjun-Pratap-_CEO-EdGE-Networks-1.jpg?resize=550%2C550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arjun-Pratap-_CEO-EdGE-Networks-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 188px) 100vw, 188px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" />Arjun Pratap is an entrepreneur, the founder and CEO of HR Tech start-up, EdGE Networks.
