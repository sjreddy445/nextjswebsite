For some organizations, the “you are here” dot falls squarely at step one: data quality and integrity. Some aren’t even sure how many employees they have and many don’t have global data standards.</p><p>Those farther along the journey are able to convert data into basic reports: employee lists and extracts, compliance reporting and the like. Some have moved on to being able to perform basic analytics for a single process, such as recruiting, using a single source of data.</p><p>Next, let’s look at those who can integrate multiple sources of data (HR and non HR) to conduct cross-functional and cross-process analytics, such as sales force effectiveness.</p><p>Finally, those organizations that have reached the sought-after destination and are able to conduct advanced predictive analytics about their organization, workforce and jobs.</p><h3><strong>The process</strong></h3><p><br>It is helpful to start by tackling a particular workforce issue and seeing it through a process—from data to insights to actions. For example, suppose you have critical skills gaps in your workforce that need to be filled. Here’s how you might proceed.</p><p>The process allows you to focus on an issue and be enabled and empowered by technology advanced technology like <a href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"><strong>artificial intelligence in hr</strong></a>.
