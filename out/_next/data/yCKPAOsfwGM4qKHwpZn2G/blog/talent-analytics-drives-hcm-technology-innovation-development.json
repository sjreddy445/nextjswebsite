In this report Gartner emphasizes the key role analytics plays in recruitment, learning and employee engagement.</p>\n<p>Research has proven that Talent Analytics helps hire quality talent and improves cycle time. Predictive analytics is going to be the game-changer especially for large organization competing in the highly competitive recruitment market. However, most organizations are either using analytics on an ad hoc basis or apprehensive about moving away from intuitive people decision making.</p>\n<p>This is due to a combination of lack of data culture in the organization and also the historical reputation that HR is not about data. On the contrary, HR could gain immensely from data analytics as they are privy to a large amount of data. It helps them forecast future needs so that the organization has a robust talent pipeline and engaged set of people.</p>\n<p>Gartner defines some key areas that HR and HR IT leaders must consider: Do your recruitment practices ensure sufficient diversity in the workplace? Do you truly believe that you are recruiting the best people for the job? Do you believe you are getting value for money from your learning management system (LMS)? Is there adequate regular use of your LMS by your employees? Are your employees truly developing their skills and expertise? Do your current employee engagement practices go far enough to understand the emotional commitment of your employees to your organization?</p>\n<p>Gartner’s “research shows that very few organizations have achieved all of the capabilities included in the above questions.” EdGE Networks has been listed as one of the Cool Vendors in HCM that is addressing these issues.</p>\n<p>Gartner, Cool Vendors in Human Capital Management, 2016, May 9, 2016</p>\n<p><em>Gartner does not endorse any vendor, product or service depicted in its research publications, and does not advise technology users to select only those vendors with the highest ratings or other designation.
