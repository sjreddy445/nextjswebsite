We are in conversation with Lloyd Mathias. He is; what do I say about sir? He is a Pan-Asia business leader, marketer, strategist. He has intimate knowledge of the region and, you know, a proven track record of creating compelling visions, driving business performance across domains, you name it, and he has been there. So, I've known him, I think, for the last 14-15 years now. It's been a wonderful experience, you know, knowing, sir, and interacting with him over the years; he has led and motivated teams on a platform of trust, performance, and respect. He's been with HP, Tata, Motorola, PepsiCo. So, as I said, you name it, and sir has been there. So welcome to EDGE, sir.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias:</strong> Thank you and Anannya, wonderful to reconnect with you. And such a pleasure to do for such a long time. This conversation, great stuff. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, as I said, this interview is a part of a series called <i><strong>The New Talent Paradigm</strong></i>, where we are trying to understand the shifts that are taking place in the workplace, what lies for the future. So, the aim of this interview is to know your thoughts on this paradigm across organisations, especially in sales and marketing. Okay, so we begin? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Absolutely, looking forward. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya: </strong>So, what is the talent shift that is happening in organizations today? You know, especially in times of the pandemic, what, what do you think?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Ans: So when I think, looking back at the last 20-24 four months, I think few of us would have imagined the extent and the duration of disruption that the pandemic would have caused, you know, if you were in our lives back to exactly two years ago, say, December 2019, I think few of us would have envisaged the scale of you know, what was to come in the next two years. And I guess the worrying part is that it's still not over. Right, as we speak, we're still looking ahead with some degree of uncertainty, panels hearing about the Omicron variant and what it can do. So, therefore, I think that, in a sense, it itself is startling. This is, you know, for most of us would be a once in a lifetime event. And it has reset many things. It has reset personal priorities, has reset organizational priorities, and made big and small startups rethink their entire people strategies. In terms of specifically the talent shift in organisations today, I think two things are standing out. One is that varied work options are becoming table stakes. So, time agnostic work, remote working, distributed teams, job sharing, of these were kind of slightly, you know, alien concepts to about two or three years back. Barring a few people who had teams across the globe. This was not a norm, right. So, all of us had, let's say, a fair share of business calls. But these were like weekly calls and such like, now, the fact that most of us are doing eight to 10 hours on Zoom, or teams of Google meets itself is different. But more than that, I think it's also the fact that the pandemic has blurred the lines between work and play that for a lot of us. It is, yes, we might get to our workstations at nine in the morning. But very often, we're compared to what we end up doing, calls or emails late into the day. So, it's time for agnostic work; remote working has become a way of life - distributed teams, working remotely. Today, you will have people working from across cities within the same city, they are in different locations, and a lot of jobs get farmed out in what is called job sharing. So, in terms of talent shift, I think two things are standing out. I think one is organizations are looking at employees who can handle this uncertainty, right, the fact that it's not business as usual. Second, I think everyone, and this is both an individual and organizational, you know, the question is they're looking for people who are resilient, right, people who are able to handle all this uncertainty and still kind of cope, you know, without feeling unduly pressured. Third, I think there's also seek for a basic amount of tech-savviness right today, what is expected not just in terms of handling calls, but in terms of, you know, structuring your entire work online. In terms of organizations, I see two big things in the time shift. I think one is accepting the reality of a variable workforce; you don't need to have all employees physically at one location, you know, at one geography. I think that's become real. The second is shorter engagements - I think, you know, early elements of the gig economy are now beginning to be real. So, companies are looking at short term work contracts, hiring people for specific roles for a specific time period. And therefore, outsourcing has now become more mass; earlier outsourcing was slightly more specialised, it was kind of more technology-related. Today, it's normal to outsource things strictly a part of the core business because you recognise that the job can be done in a variable context. And part of it is also the pressures that organizations see uncertainty, so they want to pull back on costs. So, therefore, outsourcing has become real. So, suppose I were to look at the critical elements of the talent shift. In that case, I think one is, you know, looking for employees who can be resilient and who can handle uncertainty, looking at Tech-savvy folk, looking at a variable workforce, shorter engagements, and outsourcing.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, as you said that today, organizations are outsourcing for all kinds of roles. Right earlier, it was technology, more technology. Now, it's gone beyond technology. Now. It's pretty much all kinds of roles. And the gig workforce is it. You know, where do you see the future? Because, yes, it's outsourcing. It's a part of outsourcing. So, where do you see the future of the gig workforce in this context? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Ans: Yeah, before we get down precisely to the gig workforce, I just want to set the context of how we see it. I think one is, you know, millennials or Gen Y's sometimes call them their company comprise 35 34% of India's population, right now already about nearing 50% of the workforce. By 2025 this is expected to reach 75%. More than the statistics, I think it's the mindset of these millennials that is important. That is key.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">One is – increasingly, millennials are beginning to become key decision-makers and organizations. In fact, the bulk of startups is being founded by people in their 20s and 30s who are pretty much-called millennials. Now, the way they're looking at this whole work situation is radically different from, let's say, a generation that was, you know, in positions of power, say about a decade and a half back to the early 2000s. So, millennials, I believe, have enough research to prove it are concerned about work-life balance. There was a survey done by Deloitte a couple of years ago, it said that almost 70% of millennials evaluate career opportunities, by good work-life balance, even more than organizations that they can progress in. So that has become a primary driver. And therefore, they're seeking flexibility in their work options. So, consequently, I would say the gig economy is happening on two ends. One is organizations that are seeing or feeling the pressure of uncertainty, who are trying to pull back on costs and work on what is called an asset-light model. So, they want to work with a variable workforce, and two is that there are a lot of younger people in the workforce who do not wish to stand committed. So, there was a client in my work career in the early 90s; we all looked for long, secure, ten years. You look for organizations that will help you grow and where you could spend 5-10 years or maybe more. Today, the average, we'll be looking at the kind of the growth what he's looking at jobs where, you know, if he's not satisfied in a year or two, he moves. So, I think this gig economy is becoming real on both sides of the fence, both aided by employers who are looking at shorter work contracts, more variable workforce, and by younger employees who are looking at, you know, fulfilling their passions, at the same time kind of making enough to get them going. Right. So, they're not really looking necessarily at logging 14-15 hours at work; they’re looking at, kind of, living a life independently by the side. And therefore, the gig economy is becoming real. And I think that is a positive strength, though, what I would say is that the economy has to be looked at in slightly more longer-term aspects. One is how companies can change the structures to accommodate gig workers in a more rational manner. And then secondly, and more critically, what are the underlying security issues that could take care of the workers? The obvious advantages of formal employment, you know, kind of provident fund and medical benefits and kind of long-term accumulations, ESOP's and such like? To what extent would gig workers also be able to accrue these benefits? And I think those are things that policymakers need to look at deeply.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, as we see that the way people are working is changing, both from at the organizational level and an individual level. So now, how, in a similar concept, how is hiring changing in this way, because, as you said, we were all looking for long term security. So, hiring’s used to be different, more face-to-face, plus, you know, benefits of provident fund and all that. Now, with the gig workforce, the way they are being hired by an organization, it comes to security the way they are hiring more offline conversations. So, if I ask you what you've seen? How is hiring changing in this concept? And what should? What is the role HR is playing?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>I think hiring has been kind of, you know, significantly impacted. So key terms are that when organizational priorities have changed, and the pandemic has hit everyone very hard, I think hiring is a function that has had to kind of rework itself. The same old practices now may fall short to some extent. So, at a fundamental level, I think what hires are doing is working closely with the corporate teams to really look at what percentage of workers do they need to have on full-time roles and what percentage of work can be kind of contracted outside. So that’s one aspect. The second is I think they're also looking at strong traits, when hiring traits of nimbleness have the versatility of people who are capable of moving around roles, right. So, the rigidity of the fact that you're hiring somebody, a specialist vs somebody who can, in a sense, move across roles, maybe not functions, but certainly across roles. Because nimbleness is one critical aspect. Also, hiring is looking at, which are the roles that can be seamlessly outsourced without having to have a full-time resource. So, I think hiring has per-force had to embrace the gig economy. And like I said, for organizations, this new employee model works because it helps low fixed costs, reduces overhead expenditures, and limits their exposure to long-term medical expenses and lead costs. It enhances flexibility by having term and project-based contracts business needs and helps them acquire specialised talent for specific requirements. Very often, organizations found that they didn't have talent, and they had to end up training people. Now it's so easy to kind of go and secure that talent from outside of the short-term contract; you don't need to get someone on a full-time basis. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Q4: A small thing that I want to know is that when we've been talking of the pandemic, and the hiring in this context, most discussions revolve around IT organizations. Right. So, you know, you've been into sales, marketing, public relations, etc. These verticals have also changed, seen a very drastic shift in how their day-to-day operations were and how they are today. Why? Because they have always been very client-facing. So, how has it impacted their work and the business?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Ans: Oh, I would see a couple of points. Around Yeah, I think fundamentally; all functions have been impacted. However, you know, and I'm speaking with specific reference to a couple of organizations that I work closely with one of whose boards I sit on, I think, organizations have kind of had to face the difficult question that why large sections of the workforce could work remotely - all the staff functions, like HR or finance or legal or various functions to categories have still pretty much at least the moment the lockdown is lifted, had to be back on the ground, right, one way or the Salesforce, especially those who are customer-facing, we're meeting, you know, distributors or retailers. And the other word in a sense, factory workers, right, a lot of factories can work remotely. So, I think one is the realization that sales and marketing cannot always be done remotely, right? I guess media buying and such functions can but when you think of operations, marketing when you think of, in-store, retailer relations, I think those are something that have been impacted. So, I think that's where the real challenge lies, I think in functions like sales, marketing, PR, I think those which are customer-facing which require physical contact, I think they've kind of been relatively more impacted. But like I said, the traits that HR is looking for organizations looking for people who are resilient, who can handle this uncertainty, people who can multitask, because you're talking about people who can, for example, I know an organization that was in event management. Now all of us know that in the last few years, event management has kind of virtually come to a halt. Now, they've had to actually repurpose some of their teams to start looking at different aspects. So, a lot of them today are helping organize virtual events, and therefore have to become technologically savvy. They have to kind of rework a lot of their skill sets. They've also had some of the front-facing account executive staff learning production. So, they're kind of gearing up for a kind of post-pandemic future. I think those who are willing to put up their hand and say, “Hey, I'm willing to multiscale, I'm willing to try something”, it's kind of helping. Whereas those who are being rigid and saying, “okay, this is what I was hired to do, this is what I'm going to do”, are going to face problems. So, I think the ability, or you can say that versatility and nimbleness are now becoming a critical aspect of how HR starts looking at hires all across, but more specifically within the kind of tools and marketing domains.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, you've answered a part of my next question, which is like, the new skills that you see are in demand for the future. You’ve told me about non-tech skills like being resilient, multitasking, being nimble. Are there any other skills that you think that the new workforce should develop to be in business? Because whatever we've learned, we've, we've had to relearn. Right, so any other skills, you think that is important for the next-gen workforce to gather?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Absolutely, I think the biggest single skill that opticians are looking for, and I can say this, both for big and small organizations that I've worked closely with, is the willingness to learn. So, I think now more than ever, the ability to upskill, or rescale, is critical and positive. And fortunately, today, there are a lot of opportunities for employees to actually upskill and rescale. Right, there are online courses, there are various ways that you can actually make not just career switches, but become multi-skilled, right. So, I would say the willingness to learn, the willingness to upskill, to rescale. To try one hand as one's hand at new things has become critical, just one data point. And it's not strictly in the context of work, the last year and a half, have seen virtually a doubling in the number of retail investors in the stock market. Right. So, we're talking about the fact that a lot of people today are realizing that it's fairly easy to open an online trading account, right, you don't have to go through a broker and kind of do a small volume of either day trades a small amount of stock trading. Now, at one level, this is a risky investment strategy. But the fact is, people have realized that you're going to spend eight to 10 hours a day in front of a computer on calls in that free time. Can I also be doing a little trading with a little bit of training? A lot of this is self-taught. These are people who've kind of gone online, taking courses or even just gone to a YouTube video, and kind of have learned the way they started with a small corpus of let's say, a couple of 1000 rupees and overtime today are you know, are taking risks. So, I think learning is now becoming primary. Earlier in an organization, you expected the organization to work at learning and development for you as an individual. I think now the onus is on the individual, to what extent can he upskill? To what extent can he rescale? To what extent can he make himself more employable in a kind of future that is going to be more gig related? Long term job contracts are going to possibly reduce is my feeling and therefore the ability to move seamlessly to new roles, maybe new sectors and emerging sectors. Who would imagine, say five years from now? You know, roles in the metaverse in artificial in augmented reality and virtual reality will become mainstream. So, people who are willing to actually move ahead of the curve maybe will find themselves in far better employment situations.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Right. So, my last question is, we've seen a lot and a lot of talk around D and I, especially in the last one and a half, two years. So, you know, I was speaking to Shruthi Bopaiah, who is the Head - Client Engagement at Bridgeweave? And we got great insights on what is needed to be done in D&amp;I, what organizations need to do at an organizational level. And at an individual level. The fact is that these things need to come from us within. But how are you seeing it shape up in India? I mean, is it really being taken seriously by the leadership in large companies? Or is it just a tick box? What are your views on it?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>I think, diversity, equity and inclusion are now becoming a reality of business. And I think most mature businesses are beginning to see it well beyond a tick box. I think companies are taking Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. For one, it's no longer nice to do. I think people are recognizing that this adds value to the core of your business proposition, a business that works closely on DEI and who looks at environmental, social, and corporate governance, there is empirical evidence to prove is more successful. So, it's no longer a nice to do. Also, I think, importantly, in increasing polarizing times, like the ones we live in, it makes sense for companies to broad base their workforce. So, in a sense, it's a hedge against this polarization, and the best way you can hedge against polarization is by having people across the spectrum. Whether it's gender, whether it's a kind of multi-faith or multi-kind of cultural organizations, or even people who respect the fact that people can have different sexual orientations. So, I think DEI is now absolutely critical. To my mind, most organizations are taking them very seriously, for one reason is that increasingly, a lot of investors are beginning to look at the organization in this equity lens, right. So, they're looking at organizations through an ESG window, they're looking at organizations to how good they are on D&amp;I. And I think that's becoming critical. The second, I believe, it's also good for business. If a business reflects the society in which it works in, it can only work better. I will say an organization that has, let's say, gender parity, and the same people from both genders as senior levels is positive. I think an organization that learns to respect people's different orientations or works with people across multi faiths or multi-cultures, I think it works very well. And therefore, when I see DNI, I'm looking at more than just the basic gender diversity. I'm also looking at thought diversity. When I ran marketing for very large companies, I think the best results came when you had a team that was multicultural people who came from different parts of the country or different regions, because they each bought a different sensibility, a different thought, a different dimension to an entire, you know, campaign or whatever. So, I think DEI is more than just a tick-in-the-box. I think it's mainstream. And it must over time get stronger. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">I want to take some time and comment about two other issues Anannya, in the context of what we're talking about. One is a little about the future of the workspace. And the other is, of course, the current little concerns people have on the variant and what does it do? I think what is totally why things were seemingly getting to kind of, you know, getting back to the normal curve in a small manner, I think this Omicron variant has kind of put a little bit of a hold on plans. So, I would see that the uncertainty is certainly going to be part of us for the next few months. A lot of us believe that you know, early 2022 will resume or get back to as near normalcy as possible. I think there's a little bit of trepidation, a little bit of a kind of concern about how this thing works. But hopefully, things will settle in my mind around the middle of the second half of 2022. And in the context of our discussion, if I were to kind of look at the workplace future, I think two to two trends are emerging in my mind. I think organizations are going to be adopting a more flexible work arrangement for their employees and also for their own benefit. So, I think the ability of an organization to start looking at Flexi or Flexitime offers both workings of having smaller offices downsizing and possibly highlighting people who are from remote locations. So, I think that's one trend, that's certainly going to be real. And the second, I think, is a more widespread adoption of the gig economy. I think people are recognizing that you're going to have gig workers as an essential part of your workforce, right, the old organizational structures where you had almost 80 90% of people on roles barring for very peripheral kinds of tasks, which you outsourced, I think, you know, that is going to reduce increasingly over time, what you're going to have possibly is a much more healthier mix of part-time contract, or gig workers was the core team that's going to be strung together, which is part of the core organization. And I think we're moving definitely in that direction. And therefore, like I said, earlier in this discussion, the onus for especially younger employees, to multi-skill to learn new skills, to get familiar with, with, let's say, technologies of the future, right, would be helpful. Like for Apple, I know for a fact that a lot of organizations, value people who've taken courses in Python, saying, “Hey, if AI is of the future, then someone who works in that will work”. I think those were some of the thoughts that I wanted to add on to this.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, one quick question, while you were telling me the future of the workforce, I was reading this report, I don't remember the name of the organization. But, you know, I was reading that, with this growth of the gig workforce. This, this workforce will also move towards multiple jobs, you know, in a day, in the sense, I, they will be working not for organization x, but x, y, z. You know, so what are your thoughts? Because while we've probably never thought of that, never thought we will do two jobs together or three jobs together with the same kind of organization, the same kind of skills, but now this is opening up. There are organizations that are allowing, and there are individuals who are willing to do this? What is your thought in terms of this future? The data, the security, whatever, all of that, that which is involved here?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Lloyd Mathias: </strong>Yeah, I think, therefore, it's probably normal for gig workers, not just to look at flexibility in terms of work times, but also flexibility in terms of roles, or from seamlessly moving to do work with two or three organizations parallelly in the same day, right, I could be doing a project with one company, the morning and towards the afternoon, something else, right, normal. I think the pandemic is also underlying, and I can speak from, let's say, my last few years in the IT space, has also underlined the importance of network security and some of these issues, right, we take for granted a lot of the elements in the physical office, right, where you have firewalls, where you have a certain degree of confidentiality protection, because of the way or, you know, you're kind of network is configured. But now you're talking about the bulk of the workforce being removed, right, and working from anywhere in the country. And a lot of environments are not in secure networks. People are working on public networks in co-working spaces and such like. So, I think the emphasis on network and security and protecting an organizations’ assets, I think now is emphasized. So, organizations that have strong business continuity plans in place, actually, they've put clear mandates about how they can handle this. And that also involves, therefore, providing employees with the necessary infrastructure, not everyone has access to a high-speed broadband connection, or not everyone has access to a kind of home office, which is, you know, totally kind of confidential away from your spouse or from you know, other interferences. So, I think that has become an important aspect. And I think organizations and individuals have to start thinking about that. So, all of us need to carve out our little workspaces at home. And it's not always very easy, you know, crowded, small apartments, let's say, cities like Mumbai, where you have a family of four or five living in small places, with the kids going to school or attending online school, the husband and wife both having jobs that require calls. Do you have the broadband infrastructure? Do you have that many sets of computers, tablets, etc.? So, I think it's kind of putting the emphasis, but clearly, the future organization will start to have to look at these things very deeply. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Thank you so much, sir, for your time.

He is; what do I say about sir? He is a Pan-Asia business leader, marketer, strategist. He has intimate knowledge of the region and, you know, a proven track record of creating compelling visions, driving business performance across domains, you name it, and he has been there. So, I've known him, I think, for the last 14-15 years now. It's been a wonderful experience, you know, knowing, sir, and interacting with him over the years; he has led and motivated teams on a platform of trust, performance, and respect. He's been with HP, Tata, Motorola, PepsiCo. So, as I said, you name it, and sir has been there. So welcome to EDGE, sir.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you and Anannya, wonderful to reconnect with you. And such a pleasure to do for such a long time. This conversation, great stuff.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, as I said, this interview is a part of a series called \u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe New Talent Paradigm\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e, where we are trying to understand the shifts that are taking place in the workplace, what lies for the future. So, the aim of this interview is to know your thoughts on this paradigm across organisations, especially in sales and marketing. Okay, so we begin?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely, looking forward.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSo, what is the talent shift that is happening in organizations today? You know, especially in times of the pandemic, what, what do you think?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAns: So when I think, looking back at the last 20-24 four months, I think few of us would have imagined the extent and the duration of disruption that the pandemic would have caused, you know, if you were in our lives back to exactly two years ago, say, December 2019, I think few of us would have envisaged the scale of you know, what was to come in the next two years. And I guess the worrying part is that it's still not over. Right, as we speak, we're still looking ahead with some degree of uncertainty, panels hearing about the Omicron variant and what it can do. So, therefore, I think that, in a sense, it itself is startling. This is, you know, for most of us would be a once in a lifetime event. And it has reset many things. It has reset personal priorities, has reset organizational priorities, and made big and small startups rethink their entire people strategies. In terms of specifically the talent shift in organisations today, I think two things are standing out. One is that varied work options are becoming table stakes. So, time agnostic work, remote working, distributed teams, job sharing, of these were kind of slightly, you know, alien concepts to about two or three years back. Barring a few people who had teams across the globe. This was not a norm, right. So, all of us had, let's say, a fair share of business calls. But these were like weekly calls and such like, now, the fact that most of us are doing eight to 10 hours on Zoom, or teams of Google meets itself is different. But more than that, I think it's also the fact that the pandemic has blurred the lines between work and play that for a lot of us. It is, yes, we might get to our workstations at nine in the morning. But very often, we're compared to what we end up doing, calls or emails late into the day. So, it's time for agnostic work; remote working has become a way of life - distributed teams, working remotely. Today, you will have people working from across cities within the same city, they are in different locations, and a lot of jobs get farmed out in what is called job sharing. So, in terms of talent shift, I think two things are standing out. I think one is organizations are looking at employees who can handle this uncertainty, right, the fact that it's not business as usual. Second, I think everyone, and this is both an individual and organizational, you know, the question is they're looking for people who are resilient, right, people who are able to handle all this uncertainty and still kind of cope, you know, without feeling unduly pressured. Third, I think there's also seek for a basic amount of tech-savviness right today, what is expected not just in terms of handling calls, but in terms of, you know, structuring your entire work online. In terms of organizations, I see two big things in the time shift. I think one is accepting the reality of a variable workforce; you don't need to have all employees physically at one location, you know, at one geography. I think that's become real. The second is shorter engagements - I think, you know, early elements of the gig economy are now beginning to be real. So, companies are looking at short term work contracts, hiring people for specific roles for a specific time period. And therefore, outsourcing has now become more mass; earlier outsourcing was slightly more specialised, it was kind of more technology-related. Today, it's normal to outsource things strictly a part of the core business because you recognise that the job can be done in a variable context. And part of it is also the pressures that organizations see uncertainty, so they want to pull back on costs. So, therefore, outsourcing has become real. So, suppose I were to look at the critical elements of the talent shift. In that case, I think one is, you know, looking for employees who can be resilient and who can handle uncertainty, looking at Tech-savvy folk, looking at a variable workforce, shorter engagements, and outsourcing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, as you said that today, organizations are outsourcing for all kinds of roles. Right earlier, it was technology, more technology. Now, it's gone beyond technology. Now. It's pretty much all kinds of roles. And the gig workforce is it. You know, where do you see the future? Because, yes, it's outsourcing. It's a part of outsourcing. So, where do you see the future of the gig workforce in this context?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAns: Yeah, before we get down precisely to the gig workforce, I just want to set the context of how we see it. I think one is, you know, millennials or Gen Y's sometimes call them their company comprise 35 34% of India's population, right now already about nearing 50% of the workforce. By 2025 this is expected to reach 75%. More than the statistics, I think it's the mindset of these millennials that is important. That is key.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOne is – increasingly, millennials are beginning to become key decision-makers and organizations. In fact, the bulk of startups is being founded by people in their 20s and 30s who are pretty much-called millennials. Now, the way they're looking at this whole work situation is radically different from, let's say, a generation that was, you know, in positions of power, say about a decade and a half back to the early 2000s. So, millennials, I believe, have enough research to prove it are concerned about work-life balance. There was a survey done by Deloitte a couple of years ago, it said that almost 70% of millennials evaluate career opportunities, by good work-life balance, even more than organizations that they can progress in. So that has become a primary driver. And therefore, they're seeking flexibility in their work options. So, consequently, I would say the gig economy is happening on two ends. One is organizations that are seeing or feeling the pressure of uncertainty, who are trying to pull back on costs and work on what is called an asset-light model. So, they want to work with a variable workforce, and two is that there are a lot of younger people in the workforce who do not wish to stand committed. So, there was a client in my work career in the early 90s; we all looked for long, secure, ten years. You look for organizations that will help you grow and where you could spend 5-10 years or maybe more. Today, the average, we'll be looking at the kind of the growth what he's looking at jobs where, you know, if he's not satisfied in a year or two, he moves. So, I think this gig economy is becoming real on both sides of the fence, both aided by employers who are looking at shorter work contracts, more variable workforce, and by younger employees who are looking at, you know, fulfilling their passions, at the same time kind of making enough to get them going. Right. So, they're not really looking necessarily at logging 14-15 hours at work; they’re looking at, kind of, living a life independently by the side. And therefore, the gig economy is becoming real. And I think that is a positive strength, though, what I would say is that the economy has to be looked at in slightly more longer-term aspects. One is how companies can change the structures to accommodate gig workers in a more rational manner. And then secondly, and more critically, what are the underlying security issues that could take care of the workers? The obvious advantages of formal employment, you know, kind of provident fund and medical benefits and kind of long-term accumulations, ESOP's and such like? To what extent would gig workers also be able to accrue these benefits? And I think those are things that policymakers need to look at deeply.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, as we see that the way people are working is changing, both from at the organizational level and an individual level. So now, how, in a similar concept, how is hiring changing in this way, because, as you said, we were all looking for long term security. So, hiring’s used to be different, more face-to-face, plus, you know, benefits of provident fund and all that. Now, with the gig workforce, the way they are being hired by an organization, it comes to security the way they are hiring more offline conversations. So, if I ask you what you've seen? How is hiring changing in this concept? And what should? What is the role HR is playing?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI think hiring has been kind of, you know, significantly impacted. So key terms are that when organizational priorities have changed, and the pandemic has hit everyone very hard, I think hiring is a function that has had to kind of rework itself. The same old practices now may fall short to some extent. So, at a fundamental level, I think what hires are doing is working closely with the corporate teams to really look at what percentage of workers do they need to have on full-time roles and what percentage of work can be kind of contracted outside. So that’s one aspect. The second is I think they're also looking at strong traits, when hiring traits of nimbleness have the versatility of people who are capable of moving around roles, right. So, the rigidity of the fact that you're hiring somebody, a specialist vs somebody who can, in a sense, move across roles, maybe not functions, but certainly across roles. Because nimbleness is one critical aspect. Also, hiring is looking at, which are the roles that can be seamlessly outsourced without having to have a full-time resource. So, I think hiring has per-force had to embrace the gig economy. And like I said, for organizations, this new employee model works because it helps low fixed costs, reduces overhead expenditures, and limits their exposure to long-term medical expenses and lead costs. It enhances flexibility by having term and project-based contracts business needs and helps them acquire specialised talent for specific requirements. Very often, organizations found that they didn't have talent, and they had to end up training people. Now it's so easy to kind of go and secure that talent from outside of the short-term contract; you don't need to get someone on a full-time basis.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Q4: A small thing that I want to know is that when we've been talking of the pandemic, and the hiring in this context, most discussions revolve around IT organizations. Right. So, you know, you've been into sales, marketing, public relations, etc. These verticals have also changed, seen a very drastic shift in how their day-to-day operations were and how they are today. Why? Because they have always been very client-facing. So, how has it impacted their work and the business?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAns:\u0026nbsp;Oh, I would see a couple of points. Around Yeah, I think fundamentally; all functions have been impacted. However, you know, and I'm speaking with specific reference to a couple of organizations that I work closely with one of whose boards I sit on, I think, organizations have kind of had to face the difficult question that why large sections of the workforce could work remotely - all the staff functions, like HR or finance or legal or various functions to categories have still pretty much at least the moment the lockdown is lifted, had to be back on the ground, right, one way or the Salesforce, especially those who are customer-facing, we're meeting, you know, distributors or retailers. And the other word in a sense, factory workers, right, a lot of factories can work remotely. So, I think one is the realization that sales and marketing cannot always be done remotely, right? I guess media buying and such functions can but when you think of operations, marketing when you think of, in-store, retailer relations, I think those are something that have been impacted. So, I think that's where the real challenge lies, I think in functions like sales, marketing, PR, I think those which are customer-facing which require physical contact, I think they've kind of been relatively more impacted. But like I said, the traits that HR is looking for organizations looking for people who are resilient, who can handle this uncertainty, people who can multitask, because you're talking about people who can, for example, I know an organization that was in event management. Now all of us know that in the last few years, event management has kind of virtually come to a halt. Now, they've had to actually repurpose some of their teams to start looking at different aspects. So, a lot of them today are helping organize virtual events, and therefore have to become technologically savvy. They have to kind of rework a lot of their skill sets. They've also had some of the front-facing account executive staff learning production. So, they're kind of gearing up for a kind of post-pandemic future. I think those who are willing to put up their hand and say, “Hey, I'm willing to multiscale, I'm willing to try something”, it's kind of helping. Whereas those who are being rigid and saying, “okay, this is what I was hired to do, this is what I'm going to do”, are going to face problems. So, I think the ability, or you can say that versatility and nimbleness are now becoming a critical aspect of how HR starts looking at hires all across, but more specifically within the kind of tools and marketing domains.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, you've answered a part of my next question, which is like, the new skills that you see are in demand for the future. You’ve told me about non-tech skills like being resilient, multitasking, being nimble. Are there any other skills that you think that the new workforce should develop to be in business? Because whatever we've learned, we've, we've had to relearn. Right, so any other skills, you think that is important for the next-gen workforce to gather?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely, I think the biggest single skill that opticians are looking for, and I can say this, both for big and small organizations that I've worked closely with, is the willingness to learn. So, I think now more than ever, the ability to upskill, or rescale, is critical and positive. And fortunately, today, there are a lot of opportunities for employees to actually upskill and rescale. Right, there are online courses, there are various ways that you can actually make not just career switches, but become multi-skilled, right. So, I would say the willingness to learn, the willingness to upskill, to rescale. To try one hand as one's hand at new things has become critical, just one data point. And it's not strictly in the context of work, the last year and a half, have seen virtually a doubling in the number of retail investors in the stock market. Right. So, we're talking about the fact that a lot of people today are realizing that it's fairly easy to open an online trading account, right, you don't have to go through a broker and kind of do a small volume of either day trades a small amount of stock trading. Now, at one level, this is a risky investment strategy. But the fact is, people have realized that you're going to spend eight to 10 hours a day in front of a computer on calls in that free time. Can I also be doing a little trading with a little bit of training? A lot of this is self-taught. These are people who've kind of gone online, taking courses or even just gone to a YouTube video, and kind of have learned the way they started with a small corpus of let's say, a couple of 1000 rupees and overtime today are you know, are taking risks. So, I think learning is now becoming primary. Earlier in an organization, you expected the organization to work at learning and development for you as an individual. I think now the onus is on the individual, to what extent can he upskill? To what extent can he rescale? To what extent can he make himself more employable in a kind of future that is going to be more gig related? Long term job contracts are going to possibly reduce is my feeling and therefore the ability to move seamlessly to new roles, maybe new sectors and emerging sectors. Who would imagine, say five years from now? You know, roles in the metaverse in artificial in augmented reality and virtual reality will become mainstream. So, people who are willing to actually move ahead of the curve maybe will find themselves in far better employment situations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. So, my last question is, we've seen a lot and a lot of talk around D and I, especially in the last one and a half, two years. So, you know, I was speaking to Shruthi Bopaiah, who is the Head - Client Engagement at Bridgeweave? And we got great insights on what is needed to be done in D\u0026amp;I, what organizations need to do at an organizational level. And at an individual level. The fact is that these things need to come from us within. But how are you seeing it shape up in India? I mean, is it really being taken seriously by the leadership in large companies? Or is it just a tick box? What are your views on it?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eI think, diversity, equity and inclusion are now becoming a reality of business. And I think most mature businesses are beginning to see it well beyond a tick box. I think companies are taking Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion seriously. For one, it's no longer nice to do. I think people are recognizing that this adds value to the core of your business proposition, a business that works closely on DEI and who looks at environmental, social, and corporate governance, there is empirical evidence to prove is more successful. So, it's no longer a nice to do. Also, I think, importantly, in increasing polarizing times, like the ones we live in, it makes sense for companies to broad base their workforce. So, in a sense, it's a hedge against this polarization, and the best way you can hedge against polarization is by having people across the spectrum. Whether it's gender, whether it's a kind of multi-faith or multi-kind of cultural organizations, or even people who respect the fact that people can have different sexual orientations. So, I think DEI is now absolutely critical. To my mind, most organizations are taking them very seriously, for one reason is that increasingly, a lot of investors are beginning to look at the organization in this equity lens, right. So, they're looking at organizations through an ESG window, they're looking at organizations to how good they are on D\u0026amp;I. And I think that's becoming critical. The second, I believe, it's also good for business. If a business reflects the society in which it works in, it can only work better. I will say an organization that has, let's say, gender parity, and the same people from both genders as senior levels is positive. I think an organization that learns to respect people's different orientations or works with people across multi faiths or multi-cultures, I think it works very well. And therefore, when I see DNI, I'm looking at more than just the basic gender diversity. I'm also looking at thought diversity. When I ran marketing for very large companies, I think the best results came when you had a team that was multicultural people who came from different parts of the country or different regions, because they each bought a different sensibility, a different thought, a different dimension to an entire, you know, campaign or whatever. So, I think DEI is more than just a tick-in-the-box. I think it's mainstream. And it must over time get stronger.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI want to take some time and comment about two other issues Anannya, in the context of what we're talking about. One is a little about the future of the workspace. And the other is, of course, the current little concerns people have on the variant and what does it do? I think what is totally why things were seemingly getting to kind of, you know, getting back to the normal curve in a small manner, I think this Omicron variant has kind of put a little bit of a hold on plans. So, I would see that the uncertainty is certainly going to be part of us for the next few months. A lot of us believe that you know, early 2022 will resume or get back to as near normalcy as possible. I think there's a little bit of trepidation, a little bit of a kind of concern about how this thing works. But hopefully, things will settle in my mind around the middle of the second half of 2022. And in the context of our discussion, if I were to kind of look at the workplace future, I think two to two trends are emerging in my mind. I think organizations are going to be adopting a more flexible work arrangement for their employees and also for their own benefit. So, I think the ability of an organization to start looking at Flexi or Flexitime offers both workings of having smaller offices downsizing and possibly highlighting people who are from remote locations. So, I think that's one trend, that's certainly going to be real. And the second, I think, is a more widespread adoption of the gig economy. I think people are recognizing that you're going to have gig workers as an essential part of your workforce, right, the old organizational structures where you had almost 80 90% of people on roles barring for very peripheral kinds of tasks, which you outsourced, I think, you know, that is going to reduce increasingly over time, what you're going to have possibly is a much more healthier mix of part-time contract, or gig workers was the core team that's going to be strung together, which is part of the core organization. And I think we're moving definitely in that direction. And therefore, like I said, earlier in this discussion, the onus for especially younger employees, to multi-skill to learn new skills, to get familiar with, with, let's say, technologies of the future, right, would be helpful. Like for Apple, I know for a fact that a lot of organizations, value people who've taken courses in Python, saying, “Hey, if AI is of the future, then someone who works in that will work”. I think those were some of the thoughts that I wanted to add on to this.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, one quick question, while you were telling me the future of the workforce, I was reading this report, I don't remember the name of the organization. But, you know, I was reading that, with this growth of the gig workforce. This, this workforce will also move towards multiple jobs, you know, in a day, in the sense, I, they will be working not for organization x, but x, y, z. You know, so what are your thoughts? Because while we've probably never thought of that, never thought we will do two jobs together or three jobs together with the same kind of organization, the same kind of skills, but now this is opening up. There are organizations that are allowing, and there are individuals who are willing to do this? What is your thought in terms of this future? The data, the security, whatever, all of that, that which is involved here?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLloyd Mathias: \u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think, therefore, it's probably normal for gig workers, not just to look at flexibility in terms of work times, but also flexibility in terms of roles, or from seamlessly moving to do work with two or three organizations parallelly in the same day, right, I could be doing a project with one company, the morning and towards the afternoon, something else, right, normal. I think the pandemic is also underlying, and I can speak from, let's say, my last few years in the IT space, has also underlined the importance of network security and some of these issues, right, we take for granted a lot of the elements in the physical office, right, where you have firewalls, where you have a certain degree of confidentiality protection, because of the way or, you know, you're kind of network is configured. But now you're talking about the bulk of the workforce being removed, right, and working from anywhere in the country. And a lot of environments are not in secure networks. People are working on public networks in co-working spaces and such like. So, I think the emphasis on network and security and protecting an organizations’ assets, I think now is emphasized. So, organizations that have strong business continuity plans in place, actually, they've put clear mandates about how they can handle this. And that also involves, therefore, providing employees with the necessary infrastructure, not everyone has access to a high-speed broadband connection, or not everyone has access to a kind of home office, which is, you know, totally kind of confidential away from your spouse or from you know, other interferences. So, I think that has become an important aspect. And I think organizations and individuals have to start thinking about that. So, all of us need to carve out our little workspaces at home. And it's not always very easy, you know, crowded, small apartments, let's say, cities like Mumbai, where you have a family of four or five living in small places, with the kids going to school or attending online school, the husband and wife both having jobs that require calls. Do you have the broadband infrastructure? Do you have that many sets of computers, tablets, etc.? So, I think it's kind of putting the emphasis, but clearly, the future organization will start to have to look at these things very deeply.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThank you so much, sir, for your time.
