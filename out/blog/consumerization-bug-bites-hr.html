technologies. While it is driven by the millennials, the need is felt by all digital citizens. We all long for ease-of-use, attractive interfaces, intuitive functionality and low prices which is provided by consumer technologies. Zoom out and you will see that it’s not just technology that is getting consumerized but lifestyle, in general – HR cannot escape being bitten by this bug! This is true of enterprise IT, employer brand, employee engagement, innovation, food, transportation, infrastructure, training, on-boarding, et al in the workplace.</p>
<p>We touched upon BYOD influencing HR function in our earlier <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://edgenetworks.in/2016/06/16/byod-double-edged-sword-hr/" target="_blank">blog</a> where we alluded to ‘Flexibility’ being a key factor in evaluating job offers for the new generation and a critical way to improve employee productivity. A culture of performance over facetime and results over time spent is the order of the day.</p>
<p>There are other areas that require to be modified to match the standards set by consumer markets. Corporate training is one such area. With the proliferation of open-online courses, there is a course or two for every subject that one could think of. There are specialized courses with customizations and are easy to access anytime, anywhere. To top it all, they are not too heavy on the pocket as well. With the business environment changing rapidly, mainly owing to advancements in technology, employees need to keep themselves up-to-date to further their professional development. Training is a key path to bridge the gap and employees demand a similar experience as they find outside of the enterprise.</p>
<p>Talking about training, gamification is an area that is making inroads into the HR space. Gamification enhances the interest and absorption levels of the trainee. It improves stickiness – if it has worked with angry birds and temple run, why not with corporate training. It improves the engagement levels of employees when used outside of training as well &#8211; to communicate business etiquette, recruitment, safety, process, onboarding and more.</p>
<p>Thanks to consumerization, HR professionals are having to double up as brand experts. Human resource is a key asset for most organizations where success is dependent on hiring the best of breed resources from highly competitive recruitment market. This means that HR would have to put on the marketing hat, devise the employer brand strategy, messaging and positioning to carve a niche that would attract the target audience – the employee. Brand pride is no more an area restricted to consumer marketing: Brand pride/Pride of association is as necessary in building a strong employer brand where employees act as brand ambassadors.</p>
<p>Intrapreneurship is an offshoot as well. There has been increased focus on innovation and entrepreneurship in the recent years – VC funding is booming! Enterprises have absorbed this format to build incubators and accelerators within the organization. This encourages enterprising employees (young and old) to ideate and make it a reality while being in a secure job. The process is as professional with evaluation, selection, funding, mentorship, monetization, marketing and the works, all in place.  The enterprises gain from retaining these extraordinary bunch who otherwise would have moved out to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams and they also get to hold the IP for these path-breaking ideas – a win-win there!</p>
<p>In their quest to create a ‘Cool’ workspace that not only fosters innovative thinking, collaboration and engagement but also acts as a candy to the new generation, enterprises are investing heavily on building lavish office infrastructure replete with gaming corners, sleep pods, ergonomically designed desks and chairs, fitness centers, world cuisine available 24*7, huddle rooms, open spaces and what have you – Google set the trend. With the line between work and personal life blurring, employers are providing conveniences that make staff’s life seamless.</p>
<p>This is only the beginning. CHROs are spending a vast portion of their time and money on making their workplace a competitive advantage. At the end of it all, the employee gets to have the cake and eat it too. They are not complaining – or are they?!</p>
