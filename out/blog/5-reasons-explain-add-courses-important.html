<p><strong>4.Everything is digital</strong><br />

Being able to work with AI and knowing how it works can give you a competitive edge over your fellow employees. Since the use of Artificial Intelligence in businesses is increasing, employers look for employees that can keep up, as such employees are likely to be of more value.</p>
