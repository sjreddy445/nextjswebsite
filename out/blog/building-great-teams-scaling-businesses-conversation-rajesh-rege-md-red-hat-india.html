In your experience of scaling businesses, what were your challenges in the people element of the operating model? How did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>A. Collaboration and participation work hand – in – hand to create communities that help organizations innovate and build interesting things. While open source continues to expand into diverse and different sectors, and has proven successful, the success of technology happens when an organization is successful. What makes an organization spearhead is the strength in its core of how decisions are made, executed, engagement with its staff, transparency, openness etc.</p>
<p>So, what does it take to become a good open organization? Good Management. It can make or break both financial and cultural success. An open organization culture, where there is no complete control over the ecosystem, can sometimes prove a little challenging for people coming in from proprietary companies because the whole model, processes, team management etc. are completely different. We at Red Hat, come across such situations quite often and our way to tackle this is by balancing the cultural equilibrium and competitive advantage with our extensive on-boarding that helps with self-regulation. For eg. The Red Hat Ambassador program – The premise is that no one can find a potential or future Redhatter better than a Redhatter himself.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2. One of your specialties as a leader has been to build great teams. What does it take to build great teams, mentor and guide them through their career paths?</strong></p>
<p>For an open organization or any enterprise to be successful and have a real-time alignment with their company’s vision, what the business needs is a strong team. This also means to hire new, fresh talent who can predict the roadmap and at the same time, look at their current employee fleet who may have unrecognized talent. Next-generation workers are keen to work at organizations with flattened hierarchical structures that provide greater exposure to senior leadership and encourage thinking ‘outside the box’. Next generation ways of ideation and working is epitomized by environments where the younger worker is both the mentee and the mentor.</p>
<p>Here at Red Hat, we follow a strategized development process where there are teams and individuals who will be assigned for guidance, mentorship and find the hidden talent one has. This allows transparent collaboration through every stage by making the process conversational and open to anyone and everyone who is interested. For eg: if a developer is passionate about contributing to open source cloud projects, we make sure that he/she is put into at least one challenging project thus enabling their passion to shine in their careers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3. How do you see analytics shaping your people decisions?</strong></p>
<p>The greatest value of an open organization is fostering innovation and enabling change. At Red Hat, people forge their own path to leadership, not simply by working hard and smart, but also by expressing unique ideas that have the ability to positively impact their team and their company.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong> </strong><strong>4. Moving from people to technology, the one you are currently part of, how do you see the debate on containerization culminating?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Containers are all the rage. The technology is gaining its popularity as companies realize the benefits of the flexible service and application delivery platform. Containers simplify he life for developers and operational staff. Container based architecture does not follow the typical traditional huge architecture and need not manage, pack, upgrade, migrate, replicate all the time. It makes life simpler to manage immutable deployments of microservices-based architectures. The awareness of the technology and benefits thereon has been steadily growing, and continuous efforts in enhancing its usability and capabilities are very much in progress. However, this might take a little while still for enterprises to fully accept and implement it in their systems and processes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>5. What trends are you seeing in the adoption of containerization? So how should enterprises capitalize on this trend of containerization?</strong></p>
<p>A.There are a few things that an enterprise should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>While containers are relatively new, and thus come with more risks, enterprises need to balance the risks with the potential strategic advantages of leveraging containers. Security being one of the main concerns, one must look at requirements and decide whether containers are a good fit or no</li>
<li>Most enterprises have not moved a significant number of workloads to the cloud, much less to containers running on clouds. As enterprises move to containers, one needs to make a significant investment in training and hiring to obtain the skillsets that would be needed to build and deploy containerized applications</li>
<li>Enterprises have created and begun implementation of a cloud computing strategy, they now need to consider containers as a sub-strategy. Containers will have other uses with IoT applications, big data, and even traditional, on-premises systems that will stay on premises. Thus, containers are not just for clouds, but they are mostly for the r cloud</li>
<li>Enterprises are all moving to containers and one should always test any new technology’s scalability, stability, data, management and governance and security The use of containers is growing within enterprises, and the vendors in this space want to learn more about this technology as adoption spreads rapidly.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>6. What would your advice be for startups who are looking to go the containerization way?</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>A.When it comes to start-ups, there is a greenfield potential for entrepreneurs to go the containerization way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Operating Systems</strong>– In the container world, the need for traditional heavy operating system is eliminated and light weight systems such as Red Hat’s Atom provide complete infrastructure platform for running</li>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong>– Orchestration and management solution for containerization in a clustered environment helps accelerate Dev and simplifies Ops. For eg: How to take multiple machines and make them look like a single computer</li>
<li><strong>Storage</strong>– Converting multiple machines into one through containerization includes loads of data for which one would need a storage layer with enterprise features for rapid deployment</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>&#8211; As containerized applications are deployed into production environments, there will be increasing need for management solutions to manage large independent categories such as application, infrastructure etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>All these developments make it a very exciting phase for bold entrepreneurs who aim to become giants of the containerized era.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>7. With the advent of open container initiative, what changes do you foresee in the landscape?</strong></p>
<p>The Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative project hosted under the Linux Foundation designed to establish common standards for containers. Specifically, the OCI says containers should not be bound to a specific client or orchestration stack, not be tightly associated with any vendor and should be portable across a wide variety of operating systems, hardware and architectures.</p>
<p>Though the OCI technology has been around for a little more than a year and has achieved good success, there are still quite a few elements to work on in terms of handling changes and new demands, supporting backward and forward compatibility of the future etc. The mission of the OCI is to promote and promulgate a set of common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology. Hence the roadmap with this technology isto ensure standards for containers and future container platforms that preserve the flexibility and open nature of containers.</p>

However, this might take a little while still for enterprises to fully accept and implement it in their systems and processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. What trends are you seeing in the adoption of containerization? So how should enterprises capitalize on this trend of containerization?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA.There are a few things that an enterprise should consider:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhile containers are relatively new, and thus come with more risks, enterprises need to balance the risks with the potential strategic advantages of leveraging containers. Security being one of the main concerns, one must look at requirements and decide whether containers are a good fit or no\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost enterprises have not moved a significant number of workloads to the cloud, much less to containers running on clouds. As enterprises move to containers, one needs to make a significant investment in training and hiring to obtain the skillsets that would be needed to build and deploy containerized applications\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnterprises have created and begun implementation of a cloud computing strategy, they now need to consider containers as a sub-strategy. Containers will have other uses with IoT applications, big data, and even traditional, on-premises systems that will stay on premises. Thus, containers are not just for clouds, but they are mostly for the r cloud\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnterprises are all moving to containers and one should always test any new technology’s scalability, stability, data, management and governance and security The use of containers is growing within enterprises, and the vendors in this space want to learn more about this technology as adoption spreads rapidly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.

With the advent of open container initiative, what changes do you foresee in the landscape?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative project hosted under the Linux Foundation designed to establish common standards for containers. Specifically, the OCI says containers should not be bound to a specific client or orchestration stack, not be tightly associated with any vendor and should be portable across a wide variety of operating systems, hardware and architectures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the OCI technology has been around for a little more than a year and has achieved good success, there are still quite a few elements to work on in terms of handling changes and new demands, supporting backward and forward compatibility of the future etc. The mission of the OCI is to promote and promulgate a set of common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology. Hence the roadmap with this technology isto ensure standards for containers and future container platforms that preserve the flexibility and open nature of containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-5176 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?resize=196%2C252\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"rajesh\" width=\"196\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?resize=233%2C300\u0026amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?w=413\u0026amp;ssl=1 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eRajesh Rege, Managing Director, Red Hat India\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRajesh Rege, Managing Director, Red Hat, heads the India Operations of the world\u0026#8217;s leading provider of open source solutions.
