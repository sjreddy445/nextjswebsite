<p><strong>Expert tip</strong></p>
<p>We spoke to some experts and they all seem to agree that less is more when it comes to resumes!</p>
<p>The advice is not to flaunt what you have done but to clearly articulate the important things you have done that are impactful, and done well. In short, to make your resume read well, aim to tell a clear story about who you are and what you&#8217;ve done.</p>
<p><strong><em>And here are six easy ways to shorten your resume and make it stand out:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Focus on accomplishments, not job descriptions</strong></p>
<p>List all your important accomplishments, not responsibilities. Think about it – accomplishment statements are the best way to showcase the amazing things you’ve done at your past jobs, plus show prospective employers what you can do for them. Your list of weekly or yearly assignments? Not so much.</p>
<p><strong>Communicate right</strong></p>
<p>Your communications skills will be one of the first things to be judged. So make sure you sound right, right from the start. Use bullet points to help the recruiter and begin your resume with a brief but clear objective statement.</p>
<p><strong>Be a team player</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>This quality is a real must, as eventually every prospective employee would be required to work in a team or manage one. Let your future recruiter know how good a team member you are by offering references of colleagues or bosses in resumes or in conversation if you feel they (recruiters) are in doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Flaunt your expertise</strong></p>
<p>While the HR world will mostly be in a fix to choose between generalists and specialists, showing of your expertise will always help them in deciding what they want. Do not refrain from highlighting your good work to stand out and show what unique qualities you bring to the table. It could be showcasing your last project that you successfully completed or building something of your own, skills always attract recruiters.</p>
<p><strong>Self-motivated and Proactive</strong></p>
<p>Interviewers have an eye for self-starters. They will sniff out if you are proactive and self-motivated from your first telephonic conversation. Enthusiastic and self-driven people are an asset to any organization. They are most sought after because of their ability to enthuse others in the same way.</p>
