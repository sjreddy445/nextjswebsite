A Session By NASSCOM Product Connect - Part 2</b></div></div></div><div class=" mt-5 row"><div class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Part 2</strong></p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi:</strong></i>  A lot of us have hesitation when it comes to accessing mental health. So, despite the awareness campaigns, despite everybody coming up and sharing on social media, especially and Bollywood celebrities speaking out in favour of it, we still see a lot of people going into denial and seeing that they probably don't need it or hesitating, because of some other reasons. So, Arjun and Dr Jyothi, I would like to hear some of the challenges you see daily that individuals hesitate to ask for help?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i>  Statistically, I think there have been a lot more people approaching mental health now. It was 2% of workforce which went up to about 8% of people. But having said that, I think the idea is that people reach out not just to professionals but to each other too. So that's also a critical point of intervention. I believe the professional help avenue is also just by statistics of reference points of the number of therapists doing sessions; I think it must have gone up dramatically. I think that's the aspect that we see and will continue to persist, where people are looking out for a medium of connection and intervention and change. So yeah, and I urge people to reach out. It's just normal. It is essential, and it is necessary to do it now versus doing it two days later. Yeah,</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD:</strong></i> Thanks to the pandemic, mental health professionals are now categorized as medical doctors. So, they will also be able to prescribe medications for the disorders and do therapy. Sometimes we are asked to hide our identity as a psychiatrist and talk to them as a general physician. With celebrities talking about mental health issues, at least the stigma is now coming down. With more online consultations today, we're doing therapy sessions and consultations in remote towns and villages. Also, we can now consult in conference with kids, who are abroad, and their parents. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Identification is the most important thing because people suffer from sleep disturbances, panic attacks etc. The very sensitive indicator that I can tell every individual is to understand if you're sleeping well. If you have an excellent sleep and your appetite is good, more or less, your mental health issues are sorted. In major mental health issues, sleep is a very sensitive indicator. Sleep deprivation can start a vicious circle of low mood irritation. These days it's challenging to diagnose mental health issues because of excessive mobile phone usage, overwork, and stress. Overflow of news is also an important factor in losing sleep these days. It can be hazardous if people are 24 into seven with the movement; they keep on checking information/news repeatedly. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Let us be productive, focus on our work, immediate family members. So, smaller steps can make a lot of change. Let us at least try to help people, hold hands and speak a few encouraging words. I think that would create a lot of impacts.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi: </strong></i>Yes, very well pointed. So, can we take up some questions from the audience? </p><p style="text-align:justify;">The first question is for the both of you. So, a dear founder friend had a difficult situation where three of his employees left their jobs and went on long breaks to overcome the tragic loss in their families. And all these three employees were great workers. So, the founder is confused, whether he should reach out to them and hire them back? Or should he leave them? What's your take? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i> So, if they've gone on sabbatical and they've gone out and returned to find themselves and get past that point, definitely reaching out to them to say you're there. And whether they're in the organization or not is essential. I think that's the right thing to do. Whether they can come back because you require them, you can say it the way it is and leave that thought with them. But I think you should also do as a founder because you owe it to yourself and your business and potentially your investors to get on with it. So, you need to figure out how you can get people who can replace their skills and competence are the rules within your organization to get on with it. If they're going to come back, give them the option based on your need, and get on with it to figure out whether you can move with different people coming in and, you know, supplementing in terms of their roles. Also, they have to understand it's not open-ended; you need to get on with it because you owe this to yourself, and you need to or obviously to the company that you're building the dream you have. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD:</strong></i> I think first reach out to them. Sometimes people in desperate situations leave their jobs, but they would be in search of another. If they were happy or content with the first job, they would be satisfied, even if the founder would have approached them. But if you know, they are still stating that they can't join or get back and are still very busy with their thing. It is a challenging situation, but he has to keep going by employing maybe new people and going forward, and it should not be seen as a failure.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i> I just wanted to add one thing. One of the things that I learned through the journey, through many mistakes and failures, is that self-flagellation, as a founder, you got to own an account for what you have with you, right? It's a context of time. The fact that you reached out and asked this question is a great thing; hopefully, you get some takeaways from this and act upon it. So, there's nothing wrong with you reaching out and saying, listen, are you alright? And nothing wrong with you telling them, if you want to come back within the next month, it would be great for us, and probably getting your head cleared, and then coming back would be great for us. And, you know, I want to be able to take that opportunity to work with you again. If you find an excellent person to take their place in that month you need to communicate that to them through that journey. So you know what, two weeks have happened. And I've met a great person, and I'm sorted right now, and I'm going on; I want to let you know, thank you for being there and sort of thinking of coming back still. But you know, I've got this sorted out, now constantly have to make those tough choices. And one will be, you know, wrong to somebody else, but right to marry other people. And you got to think of that in this, make that decision and live with it. Right. I think you need to deal with the accountability and responsibility of making that decision. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><br><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi: </strong></i>Another question for Dr Jyothi, in particular, is - can you suggest some practical tips for all the stress and the anxiety that is stored within one's body?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD: </strong></i>Broadly, we can classify these coping skills as physical coping skills, emotional coping skills, and social coping skills. So physical coping skills is the utmost that we'll have first to sit and understand whether we are taking care of our body correctly or not. I/f yes, then only the body will be able to cope with the other kinds of stress. And the second is the social coping skills like connecting to other people, trying to be in touch with friends, neighbours, or family members. The third thing is emotional coping skills. Emotional coping skills are different for different individuals. Some people are doing 15 or 20 minutes of physical exercise like yoga or something that rejuvenates them. It makes them feel good because it is like all the muscles in the body are involved. For some deep breathing exercise, like a five minute of breathing in, breathing out, just focusing on the breathing, trying to lessen/ increase the depth of the breath. Concentrating on it for five minutes works a lot in reducing anxiety. For some individuals, it is their hobbies like cooking, arranging, or cleaning up the home. Even these are some activities that reduce our stress and anxiety about household chores. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">It is spiritual music for some people. They get a lot of anxiety relief by praying, believing in some higher self, chanting, etc. Whatever works for anyone, I think people can get any coping skill that they can take up. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi: </strong></i>Thank you for sharing that. Our next question is for you, Arjun. What are some of the tips you would like to share with entrepreneurs, how they can best manage their resources, which are primarily constrained at these times, like money management or employee retention? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap: </strong></i>one of the things that I realized in the journey, and what happened to a lot of startups who were on the B2C side, is that they had to deal with the changes; and we had engagements that our investors conducted for the portfolio companies talking about how they did sessions, usually every day, with the workforce and the employees to keep them connected. And because they're trying times, there was salary restructuring and reorganization rescheduling in various forms and manners. But I think in that time, what I learned was to be connected to your people is very important because you know, whoever you are, is because the people you have, and the sort of the dream will get fulfilled for them with you. So, it would be best to be very clear about that being the connection point for them. Why would they want to go away at this point is very basic, simple things, financial security, job security, the realization of self-worth in their jobs. These are essential things that you need to re-emphasize through this journey. And you might not be able to find ways to provide more financial security. In fact, it might be less financial security, but communication is the key. Lay out a plan and go early on the day with a message because people must understand that you're trying your best to organize this whole thing for them and yourself. Founders have to make that and work on ways to ensure that it is not all about money. People will want to shift to another job or want to move to another company or want to get more salary within your company. You will probably realize what your situation is if you're authentic and straightforward about the situation.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Don't try and profit from the situation. I'm not saying that that's the motivation for everybody at this point. But make sure that authenticity comes in that sincerity comes in that integrity is something that employees see because they joined you b because you're passionate about doing something within this company and taking your risk with you. Do not forget that. So that's my two cents. I believe strongly in people who built a company around solving the problems of translating the economics around employability and ensuring that people get the right jobs. And being at the goal of empowering and enabling companies to, you know, look at that talent, and then the transparency will give them all the power they need to perform. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi: </strong></i>Dr Jyoti, would you like to add on to it? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD:</strong></i> No, I think that was very well answered. So being genuine to everyone around the company spirit should never be let down. The founder has to make it very clear to the employees the critical purpose of the company.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i> I'll give you another insight. I tend to begin my day by getting up at 6:00-6:15 am and then starting to check my email around 7 o'clock. And I'm a big believer in making sure that I get a balance of exercise because that's my de-stress. And I figured out different ways to do it in this lockdown. But as I begin the day, there was an I've been, you know, sort of, you know, trying to push the bar and work through the day. And I've been talking for really long hours, which also affects your eating and all the other things that are not balanced. What I was looking at through the day; this is what other founders and looking at it, they were meeting scheduled like one after another to the degree of it spilling over, and you have to manage your time really. It's something that you can't do anything about your need to be there. And then I had this meeting invite sent to me for 9 pm. Tonight, from 9 pm to 9:45 pm. Tonight, and I was here and saying, why can't this be done on Monday? Right? The fact that my colleague wanted to do that meeting at that time motivated me to say, Okay, I'm going to do that. Because why is someone wanting to do that meeting is because they're so interested about doing that meeting, they want to want to meet on this really relevant topic. Right? It's important. So you need to also figure out through this and condition yourself for it so that you're there for the long haul because it will be a trying time. You need to take these avenues that Dr Jyothi talked about and not be taboo about this word mental. Ensure that you are all right to perform and since this direction setting for all the people out there. It's imperative to realize that while everybody has all these different things happening in their lives, you maintain a sense of balance. And guys, we're all human. So, if you falter a new fall, speak yourselves up but realize it's okay. It's not the end of the world. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Yeah, because this motivation is also contagious. Even if one employee in the companys' been a little bit more motivated, I think he can motivate the rest of them. Yeah, I love the fact that my colleagues are encouraged, and they're, you know, they, you know, it just makes me continue and deliberate and immense, I wake up because they wake up, to be honest. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Apoorva Joshi: </strong></i>That's a beautiful way to put that. So, in fact, we've come to the end of our time for today. And I would like to thank both of you for sharing your valuable insights. And it has been such an exciting discussion. And I hope the founders and the employees and everyone, and all the viewers were able to, you know, take back when key points and learned, you know, how to better manage their stress during this pandemic. So, thanks to both of you. Before we end, would you have any final concluding remark from both of you?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Dr Jyothirmayi MD:</strong></i> For me, I just want to tell all of you that this too shall pass. It's not going to stay forever. We will survive this, and it will pass, and there are good times ahead. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Arjun Pratap:</strong></i> I couldn't have said that better. And I think we share eternal optimism, which is excellent. Dr Jyothi, I believe, as you said, this too shall pass. And there are better times ahead. It's just a realization that we have to go through that we are responsible for this destruction somehow. It's not the government or not the policymakers alone; I think we need to account for this chaos that has been created. And let's not deflect and displace our emotion. It's really up to us to start figuring it out. Let's start owning that part and getting this in order. And it shall pass, and we will see better times. And that's, I think, the writing on the wall. So guys, hang in there, make sure that you know you don't beat yourselves because you feel like you're alone. Reach out to each other. It's essential to reach out to a friend, colleague, family, have a discussion. It's okay to be angry, it's okay to fight and also feel sad at times. But you know, you're going to move on. And it's not that Dr Jyoti and I are not in pain, or we haven't had our set of setbacks exist, that it's vital to have a positive attitude. And yeah, think of things with a rainbow head and a silver lining. Yeah. So thank you, guys.

So, despite the awareness campaigns, despite everybody coming up and sharing on social media, especially and Bollywood celebrities speaking out in favour of it, we still see a lot of people going into denial and seeing that they probably don't need it or hesitating, because of some other reasons. So, Arjun and Dr Jyothi, I would like to hear some of the challenges you see daily that individuals hesitate to ask for help?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Statistically, I think there have been a lot more people approaching mental health now. It was 2% of workforce which went up to about 8% of people. But having said that, I think the idea is that people reach out not just to professionals but to each other too. So that's also a critical point of intervention. I believe the professional help avenue is also just by statistics of reference points of the number of therapists doing sessions; I think it must have gone up dramatically. I think that's the aspect that we see and will continue to persist, where people are looking out for a medium of connection and intervention and change. So yeah, and I urge people to reach out. It's just normal. It is essential, and it is necessary to do it now versus doing it two days later. Yeah,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Thanks to the pandemic, mental health professionals are now categorized as medical doctors. So, they will also be able to prescribe medications for the disorders and do therapy. Sometimes we are asked to hide our identity as a psychiatrist and talk to them as a general physician. With celebrities talking about mental health issues, at least the stigma is now coming down. With more online consultations today, we're doing therapy sessions and consultations in remote towns and villages. Also, we can now consult in conference with kids, who are abroad, and their parents.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIdentification is the most important thing because people suffer from sleep disturbances, panic attacks etc. The very sensitive indicator that I can tell every individual is to understand if you're sleeping well. If you have an excellent sleep and your appetite is good, more or less, your mental health issues are sorted. In major mental health issues, sleep is a very sensitive indicator. Sleep deprivation can start a vicious circle of low mood irritation. These days it's challenging to diagnose mental health issues because of excessive mobile phone usage, overwork, and stress. Overflow of news is also an important factor in losing sleep these days. It can be hazardous if people are 24 into seven with the movement; they keep on checking information/news repeatedly.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eLet us be productive, focus on our work, immediate family members. So, smaller steps can make a lot of change. Let us at least try to help people, hold hands and speak a few encouraging words. I think that would create a lot of impacts.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eYes, very well pointed. So, can we take up some questions from the audience?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe first question is for the both of you. So, a dear founder friend had a difficult situation where three of his employees left their jobs and went on long breaks to overcome the tragic loss in their families. And all these three employees were great workers. So, the founder is confused, whether he should reach out to them and hire them back? Or should he leave them? What's your take?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, if they've gone on sabbatical and they've gone out and returned to find themselves and get past that point, definitely reaching out to them to say you're there. And whether they're in the organization or not is essential. I think that's the right thing to do. Whether they can come back because you require them, you can say it the way it is and leave that thought with them. But I think you should also do as a founder because you owe it to yourself and your business and potentially your investors to get on with it. So, you need to figure out how you can get people who can replace their skills and competence are the rules within your organization to get on with it. If they're going to come back, give them the option based on your need, and get on with it to figure out whether you can move with different people coming in and, you know, supplementing in terms of their roles. Also, they have to understand it's not open-ended; you need to get on with it because you owe this to yourself, and you need to or obviously to the company that you're building the dream you have.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think first reach out to them. Sometimes people in desperate situations leave their jobs, but they would be in search of another. If they were happy or content with the first job, they would be satisfied, even if the founder would have approached them. But if you know, they are still stating that they can't join or get back and are still very busy with their thing. It is a challenging situation, but he has to keep going by employing maybe new people and going forward, and it should not be seen as a failure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I just wanted to add one thing. One of the things that I learned through the journey, through many mistakes and failures, is that self-flagellation, as a founder, you got to own an account for what you have with you, right? It's a context of time. The fact that you reached out and asked this question is a great thing; hopefully, you get some takeaways from this and act upon it. So, there's nothing wrong with you reaching out and saying, listen, are you alright? And nothing wrong with you telling them, if you want to come back within the next month, it would be great for us, and probably getting your head cleared, and then coming back would be great for us. And, you know, I want to be able to take that opportunity to work with you again. If you find an excellent person to take their place in that month you need to communicate that to them through that journey. So you know what, two weeks have happened. And I've met a great person, and I'm sorted right now, and I'm going on; I want to let you know, thank you for being there and sort of thinking of coming back still. But you know, I've got this sorted out, now constantly have to make those tough choices. And one will be, you know, wrong to somebody else, but right to marry other people. And you got to think of that in this, make that decision and live with it. Right. I think you need to deal with the accountability and responsibility of making that decision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eAnother question for Dr Jyothi, in particular, is - can you suggest some practical tips for all the stress and the anxiety that is stored within one's body?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eBroadly, we can classify these coping skills as physical coping skills, emotional coping skills, and social coping skills. So physical coping skills is the utmost that we'll have first to sit and understand whether we are taking care of our body correctly or not. I/f yes, then only the body will be able to cope with the other kinds of stress. And the second is the social coping skills like connecting to other people, trying to be in touch with friends, neighbours, or family members. The third thing is emotional coping skills. Emotional coping skills are different for different individuals. Some people are doing 15 or 20 minutes of physical exercise like yoga or something that rejuvenates them. It makes them feel good because it is like all the muscles in the body are involved. For some deep breathing exercise, like a five minute of breathing in, breathing out, just focusing on the breathing, trying to lessen/ increase the depth of the breath. Concentrating on it for five minutes works a lot in reducing anxiety. For some individuals, it is their hobbies like cooking, arranging, or cleaning up the home. Even these are some activities that reduce our stress and anxiety about household chores.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt is spiritual music for some people. They get a lot of anxiety relief by praying, believing in some higher self, chanting, etc. Whatever works for anyone, I think people can get any coping skill that they can take up.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThank you for sharing that. Our next question is for you, Arjun. What are some of the tips you would like to share with entrepreneurs, how they can best manage their resources, which are primarily constrained at these times, like money management or employee retention?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eone of the things that I realized in the journey, and what happened to a lot of startups who were on the B2C side, is that they had to deal with the changes; and we had engagements that our investors conducted for the portfolio companies talking about how they did sessions, usually every day, with the workforce and the employees to keep them connected. And because they're trying times, there was salary restructuring and reorganization rescheduling in various forms and manners. But I think in that time, what I learned was to be connected to your people is very important because you know, whoever you are, is because the people you have, and the sort of the dream will get fulfilled for them with you. So, it would be best to be very clear about that being the connection point for them. Why would they want to go away at this point is very basic, simple things, financial security, job security, the realization of self-worth in their jobs. These are essential things that you need to re-emphasize through this journey. And you might not be able to find ways to provide more financial security. In fact, it might be less financial security, but communication is the key. Lay out a plan and go early on the day with a message because people must understand that you're trying your best to organize this whole thing for them and yourself. Founders have to make that and work on ways to ensure that it is not all about money. People will want to shift to another job or want to move to another company or want to get more salary within your company. You will probably realize what your situation is if you're authentic and straightforward about the situation.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eDon't try and profit from the situation. I'm not saying that that's the motivation for everybody at this point. But make sure that authenticity comes in that sincerity comes in that integrity is something that employees see because they joined you b because you're passionate about doing something within this company and taking your risk with you. Do not forget that. So that's my two cents. I believe strongly in people who built a company around solving the problems of translating the economics around employability and ensuring that people get the right jobs. And being at the goal of empowering and enabling companies to, you know, look at that talent, and then the transparency will give them all the power they need to perform.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eDr Jyoti, would you like to add on to it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;No, I think that was very well answered. So being genuine to everyone around the company spirit should never be let down. The founder has to make it very clear to the employees the critical purpose of the company.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun Pratap:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I'll give you another insight. I tend to begin my day by getting up at 6:00-6:15 am and then starting to check my email around 7 o'clock. And I'm a big believer in making sure that I get a balance of exercise because that's my de-stress. And I figured out different ways to do it in this lockdown. But as I begin the day, there was an I've been, you know, sort of, you know, trying to push the bar and work through the day. And I've been talking for really long hours, which also affects your eating and all the other things that are not balanced. What I was looking at through the day; this is what other founders and looking at it, they were meeting scheduled like one after another to the degree of it spilling over, and you have to manage your time really. It's something that you can't do anything about your need to be there. And then I had this meeting invite sent to me for 9 pm. Tonight, from 9 pm to 9:45 pm. Tonight, and I was here and saying, why can't this be done on Monday? Right? The fact that my colleague wanted to do that meeting at that time motivated me to say, Okay, I'm going to do that. Because why is someone wanting to do that meeting is because they're so interested about doing that meeting, they want to want to meet on this really relevant topic. Right? It's important. So you need to also figure out through this and condition yourself for it so that you're there for the long haul because it will be a trying time. You need to take these avenues that Dr Jyothi talked about and not be taboo about this word mental. Ensure that you are all right to perform and since this direction setting for all the people out there. It's imperative to realize that while everybody has all these different things happening in their lives, you maintain a sense of balance. And guys, we're all human. So, if you falter a new fall, speak yourselves up but realize it's okay. It's not the end of the world.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eYeah, because this motivation is also contagious. Even if one employee in the companys' been a little bit more motivated, I think he can motivate the rest of them. Yeah, I love the fact that my colleagues are encouraged, and they're, you know, they, you know, it just makes me continue and deliberate and immense, I wake up because they wake up, to be honest.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Apoorva Joshi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThat's a beautiful way to put that. So, in fact, we've come to the end of our time for today. And I would like to thank both of you for sharing your valuable insights. And it has been such an exciting discussion. And I hope the founders and the employees and everyone, and all the viewers were able to, you know, take back when key points and learned, you know, how to better manage their stress during this pandemic. So, thanks to both of you. Before we end, would you have any final concluding remark from both of you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDr Jyothirmayi MD:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;For me, I just want to tell all of you that this too shall pass.

And I think we share eternal optimism, which is excellent. Dr Jyothi, I believe, as you said, this too shall pass. And there are better times ahead. It's just a realization that we have to go through that we are responsible for this destruction somehow. It's not the government or not the policymakers alone; I think we need to account for this chaos that has been created. And let's not deflect and displace our emotion. It's really up to us to start figuring it out. Let's start owning that part and getting this in order. And it shall pass, and we will see better times. And that's, I think, the writing on the wall. So guys, hang in there, make sure that you know you don't beat yourselves because you feel like you're alone. Reach out to each other. It's essential to reach out to a friend, colleague, family, have a discussion. It's okay to be angry, it's okay to fight and also feel sad at times. But you know, you're going to move on. And it's not that Dr Jyoti and I are not in pain, or we haven't had our set of setbacks exist, that it's vital to have a positive attitude.
