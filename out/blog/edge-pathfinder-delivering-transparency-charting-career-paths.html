Delivering Transparency, Charting Career Paths </b></div></div></div><div class=" mt-5 row"><div class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p style="text-align:justify;">Hi, we are speaking to Arjun Pratap, CEO, EDGE. And I'm Anannya and I lead Content at EDGE. Today, we will be talking about our cutting-edge product EDGE Pathfinder and its benefits to the industry, people, employees per se. So welcome, Arjun. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Good morning and let's begin. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Yeah. Arjun like we were talking that the assumption is that EDGE Pathfinder will increase efficiency; so, how do you think it will do so in situations like we faced during the last two years? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> Firstly, EDGE Pathfinder, as a product, as the name denotes, is to figure out an employee's path in a very transparent fashion. What we have seen as a problem statement is the transparency of talent, both for the demand side and the supply side, which is the organization and the employed seems to be an illusion in many forms. And why I say it is because you come in with a certain aspiration based on your understanding of a role and you figure out that you're doing other things depending on the context of time and what the organization requires you to do. And there's a gap that exists there.  So, what am I coming for? What is the organization expecting me to do starts building that opaqueness, the Pathfinders reason to deliver this value to an employee is about transparency. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Can I very quickly very intelligently provide you as an employee a career pathway, through skilling, through understanding what your peers are doing, what other people have done on this specific path, and then also provide you jobs that are available based on your eligibility? </p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is a very employee-facing, you know, application and even a product the way we are designing it in the product managers thesis employs a consumer who is used to accessing Netflix or prime or Amazon and Flipkart, HealthifyMe or Cult or Lever, you see consumer applications that sort of used to like Lyft and Uber in the US. Everybody's used to an instant movement between point A to point B, the via media is technology. And technology has to provide the employee that instant movement as a consumer of learning and pathways. That's what Pathfinder stands for. The efficiency that has to be built technology has to provide the efficiency versus providing more clicks as a hindrance; it has to simplify the journey for an employee, make it very transparent. And I think that is something that I'm going to ring the bell on â€” talent transparency, very, very important.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Right. We spoke about how it's going to help employees, what are the benefits per se for HR and L&amp;D teams if we could elucidate on that?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> Absolutely. A relevant question again, primarily because HR and L&amp;D are beneficiaries of understanding that people because they represent their workforce, the employees in many ways, right, a stability standpoint, from an engagement and development standpoint. Right HR and L&amp;D, respectively, continue to invest their efforts current state, which is very fragmented, because they might not talk to each other because of lack of data. Again, goes back into how information flows from one to the other. And that information, how relevant is one piece of information to the other. Part of what technology does is normalize this information and translate it; the right one is acquiring the information. The other is the understanding of the information. The other is the normalizing of the information. So say somebody is disengaged; the person technically can be disengaged because they're not satisfied with what they're doing. And suppose you can take that disengagement and dissatisfaction at one level and connected to learning at the other level, which is literally taking this normalizing it to a learning path. In that case, your engagement suddenly might improve because you're starting to provide line of sight based on, say, just for the same job, the person gets more upskilled. They certainly don't lose sight of being a part of the journey of the team or the contribution that's expected from them. More often than not, you find that the person's expectation, the organization's expectation, and that mismatch is the gap that nobody knows how to bridge, and we're also talking about people at this point who are used to instant gratification. They're also talking about Gen Z and the millennial. The gig economy as we call it, where we're used to, you know, working on digital devices, working through applications that service their needs, work on, you know, three clicks to buy something, three clicks to watch a movie, three clicks to eat something right? So you're automatically saying that you're in a different world that requires</p><p style="text-align:justify;">This type of instant gratification and consuming to be mimicked within the enterprise. So if you're not able to see those signals and connect the dots between what HR represents and what L&amp;D represents, and make it interconnected through, say what Pathfinder represents, which is a talent marketplace, employees to be able to learn to recognize to understand what their peers are doing what people in different organizations or teams are doing. There is a huge gap or avoid that that needs to be filled. The moment is starting to bridge that with tech, you're starting to establish another standardized level of thinking a new baseline, if you will, for employees to start leveraging, which means is more productivity and performance that you can see as throughput, for the organization to meet its strategic goals. Because you can't take employees and say, I'm going to organize you by revenue and margin goals in a very direct fashion. Employees have to be productive have to perform to achieve revenue and margin goals, which are oriented to functional or team goals, that orientation has disconnect. So, the maximum that you can achieve through HR and l&amp;d functioning is throughput with productivity and performance, which indirectly, you know, so translates from an employee to revenue and margin, but very directly, productivity and performance will translate to revenue and margin improvements.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> We spoke about the gig economy, millennials &amp; GenZ. So, they're a different kind of workforce altogether. And their demands are very specific, very, very different from the current workforce. So, with Pathfinder, where do we see organizations move to in terms of bridging this gap, as you just said? Also, with the change in the workforce, we also change seeing a change in workplaces. So how will Pathfinder put these 3 pieces of the puzzle together? Right now, it's disoriented...dismantled.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> One, is the nature of the workforce, which we talked about is the new gig workforce, and then the work itself.  See LinkedIn saying that you can work from home forever, it just that they are the right size, the right correct based on what your location of choice is, and the salary equivalent to that, which means that there's going to be somebody who was staying in San Francisco probably got more money, and then the person moved to Austin or Plano in Texas, and then the standard of living changes, you can't get paid the same salary. So, the right, correct, but what does that mean? That means that work itself is evolving, some people are saying we'll do a hybrid model, some people are saying come back to work, some people are saying, work forever from home. So, you're seeing different things peeling off. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">It depends on the context of the outcomes that the organization wants to drive. And it's also a choice that they are willing to leverage today based on employees and the satisfaction that they can drive them. Because one of the things that I see even within the employee base that we have, as a company, people fail to recognize how these choices are made. And whether these choices are something that allow them to have a better life. Usually, companies are judged based on their cost optimization moments or profit, you know, driven actions, which is what a company exists for. Unfortunately, what gets lost, is the ability of the employee to connect the dots to the employer on what the employer is turning around and helping the employee with; latently but directly with. It could be health insurance. It could be better working conditions, and better working conditions can be, you know, internet bill at your home, right, the effectiveness of giving you a few perquisites that you did not get in the past that you can leverage from the home-work environment or home-office. How do you do that? So even organizations have to figure it out. It might seem on the outset, very easy for an employee to judge the employer at that level but it is important for the employer to also help the employee understand some of the nuances of making those calls. And what Pathfinder does inherently is it allows people to, one, start getting into a more uniform collective sense of being within the organization so they understand where they are against what they're doing, where they are against what they want to do. And for the organization to have that transparency in their talent - they are able to look at what people aspire to do and sort of get that connection point. Then you can start leveraging all the peripheral benefits. So, there are lots of things that come as you develop as an organization, once you understand your talent better. The crux of all of this being a product company or service company is your talent and the decisions that you make for your talent pool to sort of enhance themselves, the underlying theme is about establishing talent transparency.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Well, Arjun, you know, is this question that I've been thinking about. How are organizations placed today? Right? In a sense, this awareness, you know, we need to do this? Or how willing are they to adapt to this? Visibility is there, you know, they're still thinking about it? Or they don't even know that, you know, there is something that could help them? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> No, absolutely. They know that organizations are very aware of technology products and artificial intelligence, which allows them to go to the next level because these are now steady-state requirements. So, buyers are very sophisticated in their asks, and they're very aware of what exists out there. So, I think the journey has begun certainly. There's a lot of validation for competing products. Pathfinder will work to differentiate itself against companies called Gloat, Fuel 50, who have very, very solid products that, you know, sort of come to mind when you talk about a talent marketplace. Pathfinder does compete with them. The difference today is Pathfinder is very integrated into the talent supply chain, as you would see it. And we have, you know, forecasting, planning, internal mobility and recruitment products that form an integrated environment. And you have a core graph that has close to 35 million profiles that it's learned from those 11-12 million job descriptions that it's learned from and has taxonomy and anthology that powers it. It's a knowledge graph with natural language processing algorithms that allow you to get more proficient across what I talked about, which is acquiring the data, understanding the data, and normalizing the data. These are things that I think provide a significant change in terms of this value proposition. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">I think that organizations certainly know what they want, certainly know how to buy, have different models, which are transaction-based, employee-based, monthly recurring revenue, annual recurring revenue models. Procurement teams are more aware that it can't be like it was before in terms of enterprise license sales or simply a custom solution developed as a services project; those things have shifted. People understand platforms better and what the meaning of a platform is, versus it being in theory. I think those facts are clear. We don't have those challenges. Geographical challenges are more about data and literally buying behaviour versus anything else. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> I wanted to ask that there has been a lot of talk about change management and leadership these days. If you could tell us a little about your view on how Pathfinder can help build next-gen leaders within an organization and evolve the organization, help in change management, etc. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun: </strong>That's a brilliant question again. See, the thing is that the evolution of people within an organization if it's graphed, and if it's understood across skills, competencies, roles, behaviours, and I'm talking about these different corners, which honestly, today we have some of those corners, some of them we don't have. But the truth is that if you are able to cover those corners, then you're starting to not just graph the person's journey, you're also able to capture the person's inclination, performance, attributes that will signal leadership qualities that they can be superimposed against the organization's requirement for succession. Then succession planning will become a reality. Otherwise, it's really a paint job. People talk about performance, or people talk about succession planning. In reality, what are they doing, connecting people to roles based on heuristics or past signals, and they are only left with those signals. So, when you start doing it at scale, you lose sight of it. So, if you look at Performance Management, or leadership, training and development, it's very human intervention driven today. There are a few different, I mean, very few products that can claim that they are doing it at the level, which is scalable, and that itself is a huge gap for it to be scalable. You need both sides of the coin. You need people who are beneficiaries of this development to sign up to it. The translation of this development within technology platforms is a reality, and that is very disruptive right now. It's not in a state where you're plugging into building a better product, but you have to build a product that will deliver, which means that we are building a category that has not been created changing a normal course of life to reflect performance and leadership development and succession planning within parks right, not easy. Change management and leadership development are itself if you look at it, very human interface instructor lead, if you would call it sort of intervention driven, it's not yet coming.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We could be doing it this way. But you're still having this conversation, right? What if the platform of the application was training me on nudges or signals and allowing me in a bite-sized intervention driven literally every two days, every week manner, running me through a build-up and allowing me to develop my leadership skills, and position me better, or throw me courses and monitor the courses that I conclude, assess me get managers rating based on that course, and assessment all thrown the platform is another way, and I'm just making this up. But if that can be automated, driven through technology, then you're starting to get headway into solving that problem. But till then, if you create optics of having something there, and then you say that you know, people will talk to you through video, you know, interface, and then we will monitor it and record it, and you will be given a schedule that will be emailed to you. And that then is very, very free on the automation side, which anyway, if you sign up to a consultant, resume leadership training, then schedule it on your calendar, and they'll have a session across teams and zoom and do it. So, what is the automated fashion of tracking, they'll also maintain an Excel sheet. So if you take that and put it into one application and say, This is what the platform is, and I'm maintaining everything here, and that data is then going to pull through into some heuristics that science will also learn from, and then start making recommendations, that's going to be like a year down the line after you finish your first intervention, and your second intervention for that same organization or multiple organizations and collate that data. So, it's still at a disruptor level. It's a great market, but it's very nascent. And it needs a lot of attention to detail to solve for not a subject matter expert involvement and lot of tech involvement to build with the subject matter expertise on how they solve it in a man right that problem customer pairing has to be understood really well for you to build product-specific functionalities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, how is EDGE Pathfinder moving on that path?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> We've cracked the best the best level of entry, which is - we are not saying that we are doing all these things - we are doing a specific set of things for a population, which is technology driven. So, when we look at Tech driven employees, or people-oriented technology, which is now going to be most of the world, because you need technology to either directly help you in your job or indirectly apply some level of intervention in your job, then you are talking about a large population. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">When we go to companies, we're not really going to say that we are going to help you build transparency for your leadership, build succession planning for you, but we're certainly going to do it at the level where you have this large population of people that enterprises are struggling to understand. So, we build transparency for you, standardize your skill taxonomy, make sure your career pathways are understood between what we bring as part of market intelligence, what you define as HR career pathways for people across specific bands of employees and specific roles and skill combinations. We take that; we superimpose it with our intelligence across multiple organizations that we work with. And we're also, you know, looking at this daily when we graph it and store it into our knowledge graph. Now not only am I seeing signals of what specific jobs, people can move to what kind of skills they have as current to their profile, what they should be having based on an aspiration that they have on eligibility to do another job and connecting it to learning paths that say an LXP, like Netcast or LMS. We sort of connect the dots there. And that really becomes the crux of a talent marketplace. Because now the employee is empowered or the employee has eligibility and chances to figure out what next and navigation they are going to do in a career move within a company. And they're also going to say, Okay, if I needed to figure out how to do better at a specific job, what can I upskill myself, what if I wanted to move, but I'm not eligible. But if I did all of this, I would become eligible, they can make those choices today, those choices are currently very interfaced with intervention from managers, teams, and interfaces that are very static, or systems of workflow, not systems of engagement or intelligence. We're building a system of engagement and intelligence for our workforce, that can be dropped into our company, and then your employees are on boarded to it. And then they start moving into becoming a lot more real about who they are, where they are, what they want to aspire to do. And that is this signal of engagement and tension and development that you want to bring to your workforce. Otherwise, you know, even if you had to do something new that say I want to launch new health insurance policy for my employees, I want to give them a wellness benefit across the board, I want to give them vouchers, because they have done really well this quarter. And if I do it through the Pathfinder application, they're starting to suddenly see that all the interactions that the company is having driving it through the Pathfinder application as a consumer, you're consuming. And you get more excited about saying, Okay, I'm going to do a few more courses, maybe the company will give me a few more opportunities. So, what our thesis is that learning and development, career progression is also one part of the integral journey of an employee, which also has multiple other facets, which include this journey. So work is one thing learning is one thing and development is one thing, right? What are the other aspects of the employee's journey that you can cater to through Pathfinder, which allows you to say that Pathfinder is an application really that cares about those aspects have to be taken care of, which is I like watching movies, I like shopping. I like traveling, I like eating specific types of food. Now that is becoming who you are, right, any variable to graph that into what the person is capable of, through performance based on what you're graphing them as individuals across the board, that becomes the penultimate test of how a product like Pathfinder can work.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> We've spoken about how it helps HR, how it helps various other departments. But now if I could ask you, what are the business benefits? Because organizations are thinking about how it will help HR how employees will be benefit. But ultimately, achieving business targets are also very important. So in that perspective, how will organizations see themselves bowling with Pathfinder.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun: </strong>I'll give it to you in a services context. Employees are billable entities of the workforce. They actually contribute directly to margin and revenue gains. What happens is that employees can see eligibility and access to jobs, basis the fact that they upskill, reskill cross skill or the fact that a job is available based on the current state, which means that they get empowered to self-nominate themselves for a specific job, or a specific career pathway, or specific learning. So, when that happens, you're already capturing a lot of information - one is you're making a person continue to want to stay engage, which means that retention engagement is done, you're also making a person develop themselves, which also means you're continuing to retain and engage. Now, if you look at these two aspects, engagement and development, create retention and reduce attrition. Now, when you create retention, you're already invested in employees, and if they're engaging in more gainful employment organization is gaining through billing dollars.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">If you're having people become proactive to a learning path, because you're showing them a learning path or a specific career pathway that they potentially could go through, then you're again, driving them towards productivity and performance, which leads to billing dollars. So again, a direct impact to revenue and margin, it can't be more direct than this, because you're giving the wheel of the vehicle at the wheel of the car to the employee and saying now, now for that to become a reality. One is you have to have an application that allows the person to navigate, you have to have rules of the business that are fungible and open for the employee to get empowered, you have to make the ethos of transparency, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are reality for the workforce. And then people in today's context are going to say, I want to continue to work here. 50% of your people who tried and tried because they don't see any career development pathways within your company. Right. So that's significant. If you can address that 50%, you're automatically starting to build, you know, revenue and margin gains with people that are already investing, the moment you go out to hire, your hiring costs are your cost per hire, and your cost of hire is significant. Right? So, I think the map is very binary and you can really put it down to dollar value outcome where you can monitor your engagement and development to billing transactions, specifically in the project-based scenarios. And you can also do the math towards attrition and reduction in attrition based on the amount of the workforce that you're adding on your net. And so, I think there's a level of clarity that you can build on what is your ROI to project this from a business benefit. I think we as a company drive back to businesses because the nice and fuzzy is nice to have not necessarily to buy the moment you attach it to something that can build an ROI people are then going to want to buy it. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">And this is a product that people need to buy, because at the end of it, you are addressing a problem that you couldn't have addressed otherwise, because of scale, you have many things that happened, which don't allow you to provide engagement at the scale and at the real time level that you require, which is the problem. And that's what technology along with your subject matter expertise on what should be provided when should be provided get packaged well, through a product that's oriented to employees. So, I think this is my take on it. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">I think there's significant movement towards people are understanding the value for that this is not a new problem statement, I think with the way organizations have built themselves and continue to build momentum, this continues to be a problem of recognizing where your workforces the other layer that's added to it is that, you know, 80% of companies are becoming project based, our product companies have projects that there are innovation projects, versions that they build, it's very pod based, and you need to understand the configuration of upon the age, you know, company in the healthcare, you know, space or company in the retail space. They're all doing things that at a different level, it's also about how they are adopting technology to drive change within their business outcomes. And that starts relating to how do you refactor your businesses, when you think about it, today, you're talking about different modes of work, because they have the ability through technology to service that model was available yesterday, not as abundant as today, because the business continuity plans that were engaged, when COVID impacted have certainly survived and thrived to provide people with options as an organization's and employees with options on what to do as you build yourself.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Now, I would like to add a point here that some that is something this came to my mind is another benefit that I can see is when my attrition is low, my people are happy, I'm giving them a career progression, I am giving them an opportunity to be the next generation leaders, it creates my brand value. So tomorrow when I am out looking for people, the quality of my hire will also be good viz-a-vie what I had earlier. So that quality will also get go up, which will in turn reduce my HR hiring cycle, if I could put it that way. You know, probably this is also a business benefit that organizations can gain</p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> A very significant point you just said was that the because of your upliftment of your engagement, your development through, say, a product like Pathfinder, they're automatically re- defining the quality of talent within your company, improving it to a level which also sets the baseline for the quality of talent coming into the organization. And that bar. If it's increased only means better benefits to companies.  Right. So absolutely. Right. Good point. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Iâ€™ve already taken so much for your time. So, our last question could be on what is next for Pathfinder? We have already, such an intelligent technology in Pathfinder.  We are learning new things, what organizations need, you know, where we can help them where we can pitch in, what can we develop? And right now, we are seeing that that cycle is moving very fast, it is very important for organizations like us to move fast to meet those demands. So, what next? Or do we see the future in the next say I'm not going to three to five years? Because that's a long time in the next year. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Arjun:</strong> I think everything is captured within the year. Now, if you build a plan for a year, then you're starting to talk about reality to building it for the next, you know, two to three years. It's coming, no offence to big companies, but it's a big company, you know, mentality and reality, not for a company of our size where we have to look at every 90 days. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Pathfinder has an evolution to become a real solid talent marketplace and then drive towards an opportunity marketplace. And that is opposite marketplaces, building an ecosystem of other products on a platform that allows this employee to really find a life within a set of opportunities that the marketplace will continue to cater to. It means a lot of work has to be done on integrations and the creation of the ecosystem. But I think it's a byproduct of leveraging, first, the talent marketplace across the workforce that we are targeting right now. Today, we have the good fortune of close to 180,000 employees on the Pathfinder application as we are getting into some of our existing customers and deploying it. We have a lot of new customers who are looking at deploying Pathfinder as the first phase because it's about standardization of supply taxonomy, and then you can start doing it. Internal mobility as a transaction, you can start looking at upskilling and rescaling as a reality or as an initiative that you can see and translate to build business benefits. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">And you can start delivering value into recruitment as well, because like you talked about the quality baseline improving, and you understand what you really want from an employee to the outside world. And that sort of translates into how you, you know, embrace new people into a culture that you're able to support and drive. So, I think that's what I see as the next one year of getting more Pathfinder deployments, more marketplaces becoming real for companies of different sizes across different geographies. We have real targeted movement towards helping companies adopt the platform, and helping employees drive change within their environment through just this one factor of transparency, talent transparency is very important. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Thank you so much again for your time.

And I'm Anannya and I lead Content at EDGE. Today, we will be talking about our cutting-edge product EDGE Pathfinder and its benefits to the industry, people, employees per se. So welcome, Arjun.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eGood morning and let's begin.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Yeah. Arjun like we were talking that the assumption is that EDGE Pathfinder will increase efficiency; so, how do you think it will do so in situations like we faced during the last two years?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e Firstly, EDGE Pathfinder, as a product, as the name denotes, is to figure out an employee's path in a very transparent fashion. What we have seen as a problem statement is the transparency of talent, both for the demand side and the supply side, which is the organization and the employed seems to be an illusion in many forms. And why I say it is because you come in with a certain aspiration based on your understanding of a role and you figure out that you're doing other things depending on the context of time and what the organization requires you to do. And there's a gap that exists there.\u0026nbsp; So, what am I coming for? What is the organization expecting me to do starts building that opaqueness, the Pathfinders reason to deliver this value to an employee is about transparency.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eCan I very quickly very intelligently provide you as an employee a career pathway, through skilling, through understanding what your peers are doing, what other people have done on this specific path, and then also provide you jobs that are available based on your eligibility?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is a very employee-facing, you know, application and even a product the way we are designing it in the product managers thesis employs a consumer who is used to accessing Netflix or prime or Amazon and Flipkart, HealthifyMe or Cult or Lever, you see consumer applications that sort of used to like Lyft and Uber in the US. Everybody's used to an instant movement between point A to point B, the via media is technology. And technology has to provide the employee that instant movement as a consumer of learning and pathways. That's what Pathfinder stands for. The efficiency that has to be built technology has to provide the efficiency versus providing more clicks as a hindrance; it has to simplify the journey for an employee, make it very transparent. And I think that is something that I'm going to ring the bell on â€” talent transparency, very, very important.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. We spoke about how it's going to help employees, what are the benefits per se for HR and L\u0026amp;D teams if we could elucidate on that?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. A relevant question again, primarily because HR and L\u0026amp;D are beneficiaries of understanding that people because they represent their workforce, the employees in many ways, right, a stability standpoint, from an engagement and development standpoint. Right HR and L\u0026amp;D, respectively, continue to invest their efforts current state, which is very fragmented, because they might not talk to each other because of lack of data. Again, goes back into how information flows from one to the other. And that information, how relevant is one piece of information to the other. Part of what technology does is normalize this information and translate it; the right one is acquiring the information. The other is the understanding of the information. The other is the normalizing of the information. So say somebody is disengaged; the person technically can be disengaged because they're not satisfied with what they're doing. And suppose you can take that disengagement and dissatisfaction at one level and connected to learning at the other level, which is literally taking this normalizing it to a learning path. In that case, your engagement suddenly might improve because you're starting to provide line of sight based on, say, just for the same job, the person gets more upskilled. They certainly don't lose sight of being a part of the journey of the team or the contribution that's expected from them. More often than not, you find that the person's expectation, the organization's expectation, and that mismatch is the gap that nobody knows how to bridge, and we're also talking about people at this point who are used to instant gratification. They're also talking about Gen Z and the millennial. The gig economy as we call it, where we're used to, you know, working on digital devices, working through applications that service their needs, work on, you know, three clicks to buy something, three clicks to watch a movie, three clicks to eat something right? So you're automatically saying that you're in a different world that requires\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis type of instant gratification and consuming to be mimicked within the enterprise. So if you're not able to see those signals and connect the dots between what HR represents and what L\u0026amp;D represents, and make it interconnected through, say what Pathfinder represents, which is a talent marketplace, employees to be able to learn to recognize to understand what their peers are doing what people in different organizations or teams are doing. There is a huge gap or avoid that that needs to be filled. The moment is starting to bridge that with tech, you're starting to establish another standardized level of thinking a new baseline, if you will, for employees to start leveraging, which means is more productivity and performance that you can see as throughput, for the organization to meet its strategic goals. Because you can't take employees and say, I'm going to organize you by revenue and margin goals in a very direct fashion. Employees have to be productive have to perform to achieve revenue and margin goals, which are oriented to functional or team goals, that orientation has disconnect. So, the maximum that you can achieve through HR and l\u0026amp;d functioning is throughput with productivity and performance, which indirectly, you know, so translates from an employee to revenue and margin, but very directly, productivity and performance will translate to revenue and margin improvements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e We spoke about the gig economy, millennials \u0026amp; GenZ. So, they're a different kind of workforce altogether. And their demands are very specific, very, very different from the current workforce. So, with Pathfinder, where do we see organizations move to in terms of bridging this gap, as you just said? Also, with the change in the workforce, we also change seeing a change in workplaces. So how will Pathfinder put these 3 pieces of the puzzle together? Right now, it's disoriented...dismantled.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e One, is the nature of the workforce, which we talked about is the new gig workforce, and then the work itself. \u0026nbsp;See LinkedIn saying that you can work from home forever, it just that they are the right size, the right correct based on what your location of choice is, and the salary equivalent to that, which means that there's going to be somebody who was staying in San Francisco probably got more money, and then the person moved to Austin or Plano in Texas, and then the standard of living changes, you can't get paid the same salary. So, the right, correct, but what does that mean? That means that work itself is evolving, some people are saying we'll do a hybrid model, some people are saying come back to work, some people are saying, work forever from home. So, you're seeing different things peeling off.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIt depends on the context of the outcomes that the organization wants to drive. And it's also a choice that they are willing to leverage today based on employees and the satisfaction that they can drive them. Because one of the things that I see even within the employee base that we have, as a company, people fail to recognize how these choices are made. And whether these choices are something that allow them to have a better life. Usually, companies are judged based on their cost optimization moments or profit, you know, driven actions, which is what a company exists for. Unfortunately, what gets lost, is the ability of the employee to connect the dots to the employer on what the employer is turning around and helping the employee with; latently but directly with. It could be health insurance. It could be better working conditions, and better working conditions can be, you know, internet bill at your home, right, the effectiveness of giving you a few perquisites that you did not get in the past that you can leverage from the home-work environment or home-office. How do you do that? So even organizations have to figure it out. It might seem on the outset, very easy for an employee to judge the employer at that level but it is important for the employer to also help the employee understand some of the nuances of making those calls. And what Pathfinder does inherently is it allows people to, one, start getting into a more uniform collective sense of being within the organization so they understand where they are against what they're doing, where they are against what they want to do. And for the organization to have that transparency in their talent - they are able to look at what people aspire to do and sort of get that connection point. Then you can start leveraging all the peripheral benefits. So, there are lots of things that come as you develop as an organization, once you understand your talent better. The crux of all of this being a product company or service company is your talent and the decisions that you make for your talent pool to sort of enhance themselves, the underlying theme is about establishing talent transparency.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Well, Arjun, you know, is this question that I've been thinking about. How are organizations placed today? Right? In a sense, this awareness, you know, we need to do this? Or how willing are they to adapt to this? Visibility is there, you know, they're still thinking about it? Or they don't even know that, you know, there is something that could help them?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e No, absolutely. They know that organizations are very aware of technology products and artificial intelligence, which allows them to go to the next level because these are now steady-state requirements. So, buyers are very sophisticated in their asks, and they're very aware of what exists out there. So, I think the journey has begun certainly. There's a lot of validation for competing products. Pathfinder will work to differentiate itself against companies called Gloat, Fuel 50, who have very, very solid products that, you know, sort of come to mind when you talk about a talent marketplace. Pathfinder does compete with them. The difference today is Pathfinder is very integrated into the talent supply chain, as you would see it. And we have, you know, forecasting, planning, internal mobility and recruitment products that form an integrated environment. And you have a core graph that has close to 35 million profiles that it's learned from those 11-12 million job descriptions that it's learned from and has taxonomy and anthology that powers it. It's a knowledge graph with natural language processing algorithms that allow you to get more proficient across what I talked about, which is acquiring the data, understanding the data, and normalizing the data. These are things that I think provide a significant change in terms of this value proposition.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think that organizations certainly know what they want, certainly know how to buy, have different models, which are transaction-based, employee-based, monthly recurring revenue, annual recurring revenue models. Procurement teams are more aware that it can't be like it was before in terms of enterprise license sales or simply a custom solution developed as a services project; those things have shifted. People understand platforms better and what the meaning of a platform is, versus it being in theory. I think those facts are clear. We don't have those challenges. Geographical challenges are more about data and literally buying behaviour versus anything else.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I wanted to ask that there has been a lot of talk about change management and leadership these days. If you could tell us a little about your view on how Pathfinder can help build next-gen leaders within an organization and evolve the organization, help in change management, etc.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's a brilliant question again. See, the thing is that the evolution of people within an organization if it's graphed, and if it's understood across skills, competencies, roles, behaviours, and I'm talking about these different corners, which honestly, today we have some of those corners, some of them we don't have. But the truth is that if you are able to cover those corners, then you're starting to not just graph the person's journey, you're also able to capture the person's inclination, performance, attributes that will signal leadership qualities that they can be superimposed against the organization's requirement for succession. Then succession planning will become a reality. Otherwise, it's really a paint job. People talk about performance, or people talk about succession planning. In reality, what are they doing, connecting people to roles based on heuristics or past signals, and they are only left with those signals. So, when you start doing it at scale, you lose sight of it. So, if you look at Performance Management, or leadership, training and development, it's very human intervention driven today. There are a few different, I mean, very few products that can claim that they are doing it at the level, which is scalable, and that itself is a huge gap for it to be scalable. You need both sides of the coin. You need people who are beneficiaries of this development to sign up to it. The translation of this development within technology platforms is a reality, and that is very disruptive right now. It's not in a state where you're plugging into building a better product, but you have to build a product that will deliver, which means that we are building a category that has not been created changing a normal course of life to reflect performance and leadership development and succession planning within parks right, not easy. Change management and leadership development are itself if you look at it, very human interface instructor lead, if you would call it sort of intervention driven, it's not yet coming.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe could be doing it this way. But you're still having this conversation, right? What if the platform of the application was training me on nudges or signals and allowing me in a bite-sized intervention driven literally every two days, every week manner, running me through a build-up and allowing me to develop my leadership skills, and position me better, or throw me courses and monitor the courses that I conclude, assess me get managers rating based on that course, and assessment all thrown the platform is another way, and I'm just making this up. But if that can be automated, driven through technology, then you're starting to get headway into solving that problem. But till then, if you create optics of having something there, and then you say that you know, people will talk to you through video, you know, interface, and then we will monitor it and record it, and you will be given a schedule that will be emailed to you. And that then is very, very free on the automation side, which anyway, if you sign up to a consultant, resume leadership training, then schedule it on your calendar, and they'll have a session across teams and zoom and do it. So, what is the automated fashion of tracking, they'll also maintain an Excel sheet. So if you take that and put it into one application and say, This is what the platform is, and I'm maintaining everything here, and that data is then going to pull through into some heuristics that science will also learn from, and then start making recommendations, that's going to be like a year down the line after you finish your first intervention, and your second intervention for that same organization or multiple organizations and collate that data. So, it's still at a disruptor level. It's a great market, but it's very nascent. And it needs a lot of attention to detail to solve for not a subject matter expert involvement and lot of tech involvement to build with the subject matter expertise on how they solve it in a man right that problem customer pairing has to be understood really well for you to build product-specific functionalities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, how is EDGE Pathfinder moving on that path?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e We've cracked the best the best level of entry, which is - we are not saying that we are doing all these things - we are doing a specific set of things for a population, which is technology driven. So, when we look at Tech driven employees, or people-oriented technology, which is now going to be most of the world, because you need technology to either directly help you in your job or indirectly apply some level of intervention in your job, then you are talking about a large population.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhen we go to companies, we're not really going to say that we are going to help you build transparency for your leadership, build succession planning for you, but we're certainly going to do it at the level where you have this large population of people that enterprises are struggling to understand. So, we build transparency for you, standardize your skill taxonomy, make sure your career pathways are understood between what we bring as part of market intelligence, what you define as HR career pathways for people across specific bands of employees and specific roles and skill combinations. We take that; we superimpose it with our intelligence across multiple organizations that we work with. And we're also, you know, looking at this daily when we graph it and store it into our knowledge graph. Now not only am I seeing signals of what specific jobs, people can move to what kind of skills they have as current to their profile, what they should be having based on an aspiration that they have on eligibility to do another job and connecting it to learning paths that say an LXP, like Netcast or LMS. We sort of connect the dots there. And that really becomes the crux of a talent marketplace. Because now the employee is empowered or the employee has eligibility and chances to figure out what next and navigation they are going to do in a career move within a company. And they're also going to say, Okay, if I needed to figure out how to do better at a specific job, what can I upskill myself, what if I wanted to move, but I'm not eligible. But if I did all of this, I would become eligible, they can make those choices today, those choices are currently very interfaced with intervention from managers, teams, and interfaces that are very static, or systems of workflow, not systems of engagement or intelligence. We're building a system of engagement and intelligence for our workforce, that can be dropped into our company, and then your employees are on boarded to it. And then they start moving into becoming a lot more real about who they are, where they are, what they want to aspire to do. And that is this signal of engagement and tension and development that you want to bring to your workforce. Otherwise, you know, even if you had to do something new that say I want to launch new health insurance policy for my employees, I want to give them a wellness benefit across the board, I want to give them vouchers, because they have done really well this quarter. And if I do it through the Pathfinder application, they're starting to suddenly see that all the interactions that the company is having driving it through the Pathfinder application as a consumer, you're consuming. And you get more excited about saying, Okay, I'm going to do a few more courses, maybe the company will give me a few more opportunities. So, what our thesis is that learning and development, career progression is also one part of the integral journey of an employee, which also has multiple other facets, which include this journey. So work is one thing learning is one thing and development is one thing, right? What are the other aspects of the employee's journey that you can cater to through Pathfinder, which allows you to say that Pathfinder is an application really that cares about those aspects have to be taken care of, which is I like watching movies, I like shopping. I like traveling, I like eating specific types of food. Now that is becoming who you are, right, any variable to graph that into what the person is capable of, through performance based on what you're graphing them as individuals across the board, that becomes the penultimate test of how a product like Pathfinder can work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e We've spoken about how it helps HR, how it helps various other departments. But now if I could ask you, what are the business benefits? Because organizations are thinking about how it will help HR how employees will be benefit. But ultimately, achieving business targets are also very important. So in that perspective, how will organizations see themselves bowling with Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eI'll give it to you in a services context. Employees are billable entities of the workforce. They actually contribute directly to margin and revenue gains. What happens is that employees can see eligibility and access to jobs, basis the fact that they upskill, reskill cross skill or the fact that a job is available based on the current state, which means that they get empowered to self-nominate themselves for a specific job, or a specific career pathway, or specific learning. So, when that happens, you're already capturing a lot of information - one is you're making a person continue to want to stay engage, which means that retention engagement is done, you're also making a person develop themselves, which also means you're continuing to retain and engage. Now, if you look at these two aspects, engagement and development, create retention and reduce attrition. Now, when you create retention, you're already invested in employees, and if they're engaging in more gainful employment organization is gaining through billing dollars.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eIf you're having people become proactive to a learning path, because you're showing them a learning path or a specific career pathway that they potentially could go through, then you're again, driving them towards productivity and performance, which leads to billing dollars. So again, a direct impact to revenue and margin, it can't be more direct than this, because you're giving the wheel of the vehicle at the wheel of the car to the employee and saying now, now for that to become a reality. One is you have to have an application that allows the person to navigate, you have to have rules of the business that are fungible and open for the employee to get empowered, you have to make the ethos of transparency, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are reality for the workforce. And then people in today's context are going to say, I want to continue to work here. 50% of your people who tried and tried because they don't see any career development pathways within your company. Right. So that's significant. If you can address that 50%, you're automatically starting to build, you know, revenue and margin gains with people that are already investing, the moment you go out to hire, your hiring costs are your cost per hire, and your cost of hire is significant. Right? So, I think the map is very binary and you can really put it down to dollar value outcome where you can monitor your engagement and development to billing transactions, specifically in the project-based scenarios. And you can also do the math towards attrition and reduction in attrition based on the amount of the workforce that you're adding on your net. And so, I think there's a level of clarity that you can build on what is your ROI to project this from a business benefit. I think we as a company drive back to businesses because the nice and fuzzy is nice to have not necessarily to buy the moment you attach it to something that can build an ROI people are then going to want to buy it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd this is a product that people need to buy, because at the end of it, you are addressing a problem that you couldn't have addressed otherwise, because of scale, you have many things that happened, which don't allow you to provide engagement at the scale and at the real time level that you require, which is the problem. And that's what technology along with your subject matter expertise on what should be provided when should be provided get packaged well, through a product that's oriented to employees. So, I think this is my take on it.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think there's significant movement towards people are understanding the value for that this is not a new problem statement, I think with the way organizations have built themselves and continue to build momentum, this continues to be a problem of recognizing where your workforces the other layer that's added to it is that, you know, 80% of companies are becoming project based, our product companies have projects that there are innovation projects, versions that they build, it's very pod based, and you need to understand the configuration of upon the age, you know, company in the healthcare, you know, space or company in the retail space. They're all doing things that at a different level, it's also about how they are adopting technology to drive change within their business outcomes. And that starts relating to how do you refactor your businesses, when you think about it, today, you're talking about different modes of work, because they have the ability through technology to service that model was available yesterday, not as abundant as today, because the business continuity plans that were engaged, when COVID impacted have certainly survived and thrived to provide people with options as an organization's and employees with options on what to do as you build yourself.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Now, I would like to add a point here that some that is something this came to my mind is another benefit that I can see is when my attrition is low, my people are happy, I'm giving them a career progression, I am giving them an opportunity to be the next generation leaders, it creates my brand value. So tomorrow when I am out looking for people, the quality of my hire will also be good viz-a-vie what I had earlier. So that quality will also get go up, which will in turn reduce my HR hiring cycle, if I could put it that way. You know, probably this is also a business benefit that organizations can gain\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e A very significant point you just said was that the because of your upliftment of your engagement, your development through, say, a product like Pathfinder, they're automatically re- defining the quality of talent within your company, improving it to a level which also sets the baseline for the quality of talent coming into the organization. And that bar. If it's increased only means better benefits to companies. \u0026nbsp;Right. So absolutely. Right. Good point.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Iâ€™ve already taken so much for your time. So, our last question could be on what is next for Pathfinder? We have already, such an intelligent technology in Pathfinder. \u0026nbsp;We are learning new things, what organizations need, you know, where we can help them where we can pitch in, what can we develop? And right now, we are seeing that that cycle is moving very fast, it is very important for organizations like us to move fast to meet those demands. So, what next? Or do we see the future in the next say I'm not going to three to five years? Because that's a long time in the next year.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e I think everything is captured within the year. Now, if you build a plan for a year, then you're starting to talk about reality to building it for the next, you know, two to three years. It's coming, no offence to big companies, but it's a big company, you know, mentality and reality, not for a company of our size where we have to look at every 90 days.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003ePathfinder has an evolution to become a real solid talent marketplace and then drive towards an opportunity marketplace. And that is opposite marketplaces, building an ecosystem of other products on a platform that allows this employee to really find a life within a set of opportunities that the marketplace will continue to cater to. It means a lot of work has to be done on integrations and the creation of the ecosystem. But I think it's a byproduct of leveraging, first, the talent marketplace across the workforce that we are targeting right now. Today, we have the good fortune of close to 180,000 employees on the Pathfinder application as we are getting into some of our existing customers and deploying it. We have a lot of new customers who are looking at deploying Pathfinder as the first phase because it's about standardization of supply taxonomy, and then you can start doing it. Internal mobility as a transaction, you can start looking at upskilling and rescaling as a reality or as an initiative that you can see and translate to build business benefits.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd you can start delivering value into recruitment as well, because like you talked about the quality baseline improving, and you understand what you really want from an employee to the outside world. And that sort of translates into how you, you know, embrace new people into a culture that you're able to support and drive. So, I think that's what I see as the next one year of getting more Pathfinder deployments, more marketplaces becoming real for companies of different sizes across different geographies. We have real targeted movement towards helping companies adopt the platform, and helping employees drive change within their environment through just this one factor of transparency, talent transparency is very important.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much again for your time.
