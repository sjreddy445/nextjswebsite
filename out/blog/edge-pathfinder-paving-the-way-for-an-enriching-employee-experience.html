Paving The Way For An Enriching Employee Experience?</b></div></div></div><div class=" mt-5 row"><div class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p style="text-align:justify;">Hi, everyone, we are in conversation with Jacob Chandy Varghese, our Head of Product &amp; Engineering. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, Jacob, we will discuss EDGE EDGE Pathfinder - the industry perspective, a part of it, we've already had had a long discussion on it with Rahul, but we also want to know, your viewpoints as the product and engineering head. We will also talk about the technology part behind it and the roadmap </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, Jacob, if you could, in brief, tell, tell our viewers what are the problems, that are currently faced by the industry, and how EDGE Pathfinder can be a boon for them especially in times where we are seeing an evolving workforce, and workplaces? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. At any, any time or any period of time, I think, this problem is clearly going to be there — matching the right people to the right job. So, or, in other words, the right job for the right person, the right person for the right job, both from an employee perspective, as well as an organization perspective, because everything else depends on that ‑ the happiness of the person in at work, the productivity of the organization, everything depends on this. So, I think this job to people matching is clearly a good problem to have, and it's got to be there always. So, that's the industry. And currently more so as the overall skill landscape is constantly evolving, especially in technology. Technology is just advancing at a rapid pace — it’s said that every five years, the entire skill set rolls over for the same job description. People are also at a constant effort to keep up with the trends of the industry, what are the best skills they want to have, etc. Companies are also evolving, especially in India. Globally too, the software services sector is becoming extremely popular. Why? Because everything is becoming software. Even the car you drive is now software. Tesla is nothing but the software in motion. So, everything is literally becoming software, and technology skills are just evolving continuously across whatever industry you take. So, in that kind of landscape, EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very, very interesting product for any organization. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now, why does it become interesting? For multiple reasons. Every organization's effort is to retain its employees. Especially the good ones who are performing well. But then, regardless of COVID, and COVID, just makes it, even more, tougher, it's very difficult for anyone in the organization to understand what the employee wants. Why? Because the career aspirations will be different. The skill landscape is evolving. And what do you keep up with? I mean, however, smarter resource manager you are, you just can't keep up with skill sets that match what the employee or employer wants. That's where EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very interesting product, for the organization — for the benefit of the employee and the organization. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Okay. With your knowledge and experience with the product, how well do you think it is poised to solve concerns of internal fulfilment? Because see, that's not grown. That's not a huge industry, per se, because every time a resource manager or a talented acquisitor gets a requirement, the first thing they look for, is outside. Very rarely do people look inside. So how do you think it's poised to change that landscape? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. And it's a very important cost that we should play to where people don't have to look for an external job, because the organization is not able to meet their career aspiration, which is hardly the case because I mean, the reality is, every large organization has anything the employee wants, probably for a lifetime. However, the organization is not able to tap into them, the employee is not able to tap into them. Internal mobility, one of our products, actually gives the organizational perspective. So, it gives the resource manager of the organization a complete view into what are the profiles of every employee, what are their skill levels, what is their matching to the jobs which are available. So that's one view, which we already provide through our mobility product. That’s organization top down to the employee. But that's not enough. What about the employee? Now, your profile may match a demand that I have in the organization, but then that's not necessarily what you want to work on. Just because you're an expert in a certain field, doesn't mean you are eager to work in that field. I mean, we generally say that after a couple of times doing the same job, you kind of become a technology trapeze artist - you keep jumping the same loops over and over again. And you as an employee wouldn't want that. And that's where EDGE Pathfinder comes into play, even for internal fulfilment, the benefit is mutual.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, the employee looks at her skills, she has a career aspiration she defines that through our product, EDGE Pathfinder, and then looks for jobs, which are available in the organization, which takes her to that direction. Now, it may directly take her in that direction, because there is an immediately available position. Or she might see a position and say, if I do this training, because we show her what's the skill gap between what she has, versus what the job requires, she can just do training, do an assessment on the training, qualify herself and then apply, I mean, it's probably a matter of a few weeks, of just doing that. Or she might have an aspirational position, let's say, a back-end engineer wants to become a product architect. There are a couple of stops on the way. So, you can systematically work those steps. Now, through this, it is beautifully matched mutually, where the organization is still getting the internal fulfilment done but the employee is also happy. So, you are actually having a better chance of the employee being retained in the organization. Attrition also reduces, the employee is more productive in the job, billing happens, billing cycle reduces, everything gets taken care of. So, mobility from an organisational perspective, but then EDGE Pathfinder, more so from an employee perspective, gives this opportunity. And so, fulfilment naturally happens.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now, there's another problem, which most of these organizations face. People leave because they think they don't have a future in this organization. And honestly, that's not the case, EDGE Pathfinder gives transparency into that pathway, tells him you are in the right organization, you just have to look. EDGE Pathfinder gives options to the employee, you want to work in a certain domain, you want to work in a certain location, you want to work with a certain set of people, you want to be part of a certain group, you can just choose that. And then what happens, the employee stays; there is no attrition. A lot of times attrition happens because the employee is not happy, and then she starts looking out. The moment one starts looking out, your mind is gone. So, the attrition problem is also handled to some extent, that is the people who are leaving your organization for a better career opportunity can be retained in the organization.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong>  This was something that I told Arjun also in our interview, that all this leads to another thing, which we could also link to recruit. But from the EDGE Pathfinder perspective, it is reducing organizational costs. Second, brand building because if there's less attrition, your brand is built. Third, if I'm giving a career graph to an employee and that employee is satisfied, and there will be more chances the employee will bring in other people; they will also increase your quality of hire.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely right. In fact, I was telling someone the other day, organizations are like an orchestra. A very good choir where, over the years when some of the core people stay then the quality of incoming people naturally increase because over time, the overall quality of the system the orchestra, the organization is improving, where the highly skilled, highly capable people are retained. And then people from outside come, everyone wants the best workplace. Hiring just becomes much easier because the word spreads. Why is this person not leaving? Oh, because he's found a career there. It really contributes even to the brand building of the organization. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> And there's another thing that if you think of it is that a lot of times people join large organizations thinking of them as a stop-gap option. They’re like — I'll come here, I'll get training and I'll move on. I'll ask for a position, if I don't get it, I move on to another organization. However, if old employees are there, the lead is there, then they will also come in thinking that no, I have to decide if I want to stay here or not. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. See, employees are well-meaning. All of us employees, and we are all well-meaning.  Every employee is well-meaning. He or she is bothered about the career. And why would you want to leave when you have a career path and when you have people who you can learn from, and you see that they're not only staying in the organization but growing ‘like I have no reason to leave. So, things actually get taken care of. And so, you look at mature organizations, you will see people retention is a strength, while at the number level, they might have some attrition. However, if you look at the core. They stay and the core is the strength of the organization. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, Jacob, this is one part where we are able to understand how EDGE Pathfinder is helping the employee, is beneficial to the employee. Now, there are two aspects of it, which I would want your opinion on. One is how is it beneficial to the L&amp;D teams within the organization?  L&amp;D, R&amp;D, whatever you call them, and how is it beneficial to HR? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> So, let's take L&amp;D first and it is a very crucial part of the organization. EDGE Pathfinder, for instance, enables you to up your skills, so I look at a job opportunity. I see what's the skill gap. EDGE Pathfinder suggests courses. How does EDGE Pathfinder suggest the course? It’s because when we roll out EDGE Pathfinder into an organization, we integrate with the learning management system, or the learning experience system that they have. And then, it's a direct connection. Many a time the challenge of an L&amp;D leader is that he or she gets asked the question, ‘Hey, listen, you're spending so much money on training the people, but then where is the benefit?’ How is it really targeted? Now, EDGE Pathfinder actually gives the L&amp;D leader an opportunity to justify his or her spend on an LXP because the learning management system is fully justified because it's now connected. The employee chooses, she takes the training, she moves on her career path, she brings extra billing, she moves further on the career path, she brings a tree of billing under her, it's directly correlated. So, from an L&amp;D perspective, it's a beautiful add on to whatever systems they have invested in for learning management.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">From an HR perspective, as I said, multiple ways. Employee satisfaction, because finally, regardless of whatever HR can imagine and do, an employee's primary happiness comes out of job satisfaction. You're happy at your work, you're learning, you're in a good team, you're a happy employee, employee satisfaction serves its core naturally. Secondly, directly it reflects on low attrition for people who you really want to retain.  And it's very naturally correlated, people who you want to retain are also people who think about their development.  And that attrition is completely reduced. And all these things improve the brand, improves your hiring capability, makes you a good place to work in any survey that you may want to run. What better do human resources, or the organization leader want? People are the strength of any organization and it's not just IT services or anything. Anywhere, people are the strength of the organization. And we enable these people to stay focused in the organization. So, it's highly beneficial to HR. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, while EDGE Pathfinder looks very deceptively, like an employee tool, which is absolutely the intention, the organization benefits much more. There's no magic to it. A happy employee makes a happy organization. The organizational benefits are just tangible, quantifiable. I mean, you just look at the faster fulfilment of a position, the billing side. You just look at reduced attrition, again, the cost saved. You just look at training at the right time, it is an investment, you are again, spending for getting better returns. So, you look at any math you want. EDGE Pathfinder makes absolutely great dollar value sense.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Now we spoke about the benefits of EDGE Pathfinder. Now, if you permit, we would like to touch base with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder, and the features it has. So, let's start with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Right. So, the underlying of any EDGE product is the EDGE Knowledge Graph. The EDGE Knowledge Graph, our NLP based parsing capabilities, and the search and match algorithm. These are the core fundamental building blocks of any EDGE product. Right. So that still is the underlying technology, and that's our strength. And, we are always on a continuous improvement path in terms of how to really make the learning algorithm learn much more, that's our intention. Why? Because the more the learning algorithm learns about the organization, about its employees, the better suggestions we are able to throw out. So technology, fundamentally, is that.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">As for features, there are multiple features, one, I wish I kept talking about, for the employee to upload her resume, connect to her social profile, LinkedIn, GitHub, or whatever; import those data into EDGE Pathfinder, so that you have a wholesome profile entered into EDGE Pathfinder within the organization. Then you can do define a career path, you can do a skill gap analysis based on that. We are integrated into the training systems, the learning management system, so she can actually take the needed pieces of training on an ongoing basis and up her skills towards the career ladder that she wants. Now, regardless of even a career ladder, sometimes they just want to try a different job. So, EDGE Pathfinder opens up the whole feature called ‘Smart jobs’, which suggests the best-fitting jobs for the employer, looks at the highest-ranked job as in where the employer has the highest match to the job description. Makes it very easy.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">And in that process, also you can define the employee can define certain preferences - I want to work in this domain, I want to work under certain manager, I want to work in a certain location, stuff like that. So that also gets enabled to the employee. Now, the organization doesn't have to worry at any time whether the employee is choosing something which the organization is not able to meet. That will never happen because we integrate with the policy systems of the organization. So, it's mutually harmonious stuff, where what the employer sees is what's best also, is what the organization is capable of giving. And these are the essential features of EDGE Pathfinder, which really makes it a kind of a lifetime tool for the employee in her journey. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">EDGE Pathfinder also shows some very interesting things like what are the trending skills in the organization. So, you're able to see ‘what works best' That’s also important. I mean, even though I might be good at one skill, I see that this is a trending skill. Well, I want to pick up that skill. Let me define a timeline. And I'll just pick up a few courses to some certifications. EDGE Pathfinder finally takes into account all the credentials - your resume, your career journey, your certifications. The ML algorithm takes all this into account. When we actually do a search and match it's not a rule-based one, is the machine learning algorithm-based matching, where all these aspects are taken. You may talk about a skill, and you may never know that there's a skill cluster to which it belongs, and you can jump a job within the organization by just doing an adjacency skill upgrade. So, all these things are possible through EDGE Pathfinder.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, these are I would say the core features which the employee would see. From an executive perspective, the executive can actually look at a dashboard and see what are the training skills in the organization? How many people are moving their jobs within the organization? What are the most attractive roles in the organization? What are their most attractive jobs in the organization? So, the executive dashboard actually gives the buyer a sense of his investments. And you can see that in action.  The whole dynamics of the organization is consolidated in the executive dashboards</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya</strong>: With the executive board you mean, the manager or the HR head, or…</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> I mean, the HR head, the L&amp;D leader, whoever. Basically, it's role-based access. So, whoever gets access to that, at the leadership level, is not necessarily a direct manager because it's not really for the direct manager. It's for the leader of the organization. So, whoever is at the leadership level can get that, because it's a macro-level view, an aggregate view.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, tell me if I'm right or wrong, that it may help an employee, let's say, who's put on a 30-to-60-day, memo that your performance is not up to the mark and you need to improve? I ‘am giving a hypothetical situation here. And then that same employee is looking at his career graph and he sees some skill or a couple of skills that he or she can develop during that time period and jump on to another position within the organization. Is that also possible? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> That's possible.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> I mean he may not be good for the current department, but maybe a great asset for a separate department? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Exactly. So, you're talking about a well-meaning memo and then people go through those turfs of career. Sometimes, even the smartest ones go through a trough in the career where you're just stagnating. And before you realize it, your manager tells ‘Hey, listen, you're in the wrong spot.’ Absolutely. If the person is constantly keeping in touch with EDGE Pathfinder, or if he or she can just go to EDGE Pathfinder, you can understand ‘This is where it looks like. Well, I thought I had all these skills, but all those are detrending skills.’ EDGE Pathfinder gives that view - what are the trending skills? What are the trending skills adjacent to my expertise level? Let me acquire that now. If I acquire that, what are the jobs which are available? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So absolutely, I think it's a very fair tool, a very objective tool, which is absolutely fair to the employee. So, the employee is given a second chance, I, honestly, I didn't think of that kind of use case, but then come to think of it, there are a lot of people who struggle with that in their organizations. They get lost in the whole employee base, and suddenly, they just get this information that ‘well, your skills don't make a lot of sense.’ </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Absolutely. This is why EDGE Pathfinder, honestly, is a career guide for the employee. It’s a mentor. Some of us are lucky to probably pick up the phone and ask, ‘Hey, listen, there is one job available inside the company, should I take it? Is it good?’ Not everyone is lucky to have such a mentor. EDGE Pathfinder is probably better than those mentors because a mentor is also limited by their exposure, the path that they have taken, whereas EDGE Pathfinder, powered by the EDGE Graph™ gives the whole absolute true view. In fact, much better than any human mentor, who will be away, available at a phone call. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Because a human may have his or her bias by default. So yes, it can be used as that feature also, because ultimately, it will reduce attrition. Second, it will provide the right kind of job satisfaction to that employee that I'm doing better in this role than I was doing in the other room.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. You don't have to even use EDGE Pathfinder, just to shift jobs. I mean, even within that role, you can look at the skill class and keep adding on your adjacent skills. So, it's not just for internal job movement alone. It's really for your enhancement. So, which is why I said it's a, it's an ongoing guide, I mean, whoever uses EDGE Pathfinder on an ongoing basis becomes a winner anyway.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> If I could put it that way that it is very, very crucial for an organization as well as an employee. Because as I said, that if I don't have clarity on my skill sets, or where I could develop those or where my passion lies, my next job could be as futile as this one.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Jacob: Absolutely. And look at it also from an organization's point of view - it really democratizes the landscape; otherwise, it all depends on who I know. Do I know the right resource manager to find the next job? It is the complete democratization of the opportunity. And that's something which any HR leader would be proud of. It an equal opportunity that plays in its true sense. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Absolutely, you put forth a very, very interesting point today, equality, because that is what organizations today have as their goals. And rightfully so. Equality in hiring, diversity, and things like that, I believe it can also play a very crucial role in fulfilling those kinds of objectives.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Yes, this is such a natural sprinkling of equality and diversity. In all the other things, the organization has to keep a mandate. It's an equal opportunity because it's available for everyone. So, I think that brings another flavour to the organization. The organization finally benefits because the right people are again in the right job. And that's our theme. In EDGE that is our theme - getting the right people onto the right jobs, right jobs for the right people. So, employee view and organization view both are met.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> And Arjun’s (our CEO) crux of keeping people at the core of every decision. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Quick last question. What is the roadmap ahead for EDGE Pathfinder?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> See, you can only improve in the way you know the employee. The success of EDGE Pathfinder lies in understanding you as an employee as you are. And that is where AI really comes into the picture in terms of what are your preferences stated or unstated? I wouldn't say unstated but subtly stated. So EDGE Pathfinder’s roadmap at a vision level is always to know the employee better, know the career landscape better and do the match. I don't have to spell out how, there are very well-established ways of doing it. If EDGE Pathfinder can know who Anannya is in her professional life, what are her interests, what are the reading interests, What are her social interactions through LinkedIn, stuff like that, you make a better suggestion for Anannya’s career. So that's really at a roadmap level.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Also, at the tactical level, we are looking at multiple aspects like integrating with the organization in a much faster way. EDGE Pathfinder, when it enters an organization is just another tool and the HR person will be like, ‘Oh, one more tool’. But that the beauty would be that EDGE Pathfinder can integrate with the ecosystem, it should ideally connect to the performance management system, but vendors should connect to, the learning system, which is already there, stuff like that. So it becomes a coherency builder in the organization. So, integrations are definitely another focus in the roadmap. So broadly speaking, I think I would limit it to that. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Is there any feature that you may want EDGE Pathfinder to integrate in the future, something feature that is way ahead of the industry, per se right now?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> As I said, if I can have a clear, I wouldn't say quantitative, because that's kind of limiting. But yeah, if I can have a clear representation of the persona of the employee, in a very holistic sense. I would use the parallel, remember the days of Klout score, where everyone would be after Klout score? So, Klout score kind of gave an indication of how socially connected you are, how influential you are, are you a thought leader, are you a follower and stuff like that. I think the path of success for EDGE Pathfinder is really that, in being able to successfully personify the employee. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">I think the strength is in what we have already the EDGE Graph™ which is already at a very mature stage. And machine learning happens continuously and over time. So, what we have as a core is pretty precious, and the capabilities are only enhancing. So collectively, with the product and the knowledge graph and the ML core integration, I think we'll be able to come to that feature where we are clearly personifying. And then the purpose of EDGE Pathfinders will be fulfilled - showing the right career path, the right job to the employer,</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> I think it was a very, very insightful discussion, Jacob. I mean there are so many things that you gave insight on, a view, a thought to take back to think about it. How it's beneficial and what is in store for an employee with EDGE Pathfinder?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Jacob:</strong> Absolutely. See, the passion we carry an EDGE is really the person, the employee. And every organization's passion is the employee and I think that's where we connect because the organization really cares about the employee. We enable that passion for the employer and for the organization. I think that's really what drives us.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya: </strong>Right and if I have the liberty to say this, I'm sure the passion you have for products, your clarity your thought in the way the product should move I'm sure EDGE Pathfinder is going to be a great success; since we are talking about EDGE Pathfinder, but I'm sure all the products that go out from us are going to be brilliant. Thank you so much, so much, so much for your time. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Watch the full video here: </p><figure class="media"><iframe height=450 width=100% allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6tZy3uz4-GM"></iframe></figure><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p></span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><div class="py-5 book-demo-form"><div class="container-inner book-demo-box"><h4 class="text-white ma-0 title"></h4><form class="form"><button class="btn" style="font-weight:700">BOOK A DEMO</button></form></div></div><div class="py-5 news-letter-form"><div class="container-inner news-letter-box"><h4 class="text-white ma-0 title"></h4><form class="form"><input type="email" placeholder="Your Email Address" value="" name="EMAIL"/><input type="text" style="display:none" name="b_f659ca1b353586a0c99df3cad_0049088ee0" tabindex="-1" value=""/><button class="btn btn-primary" type="submit">SUBMIT</button></form></div></div><div class="bold-grey-bg"><div class="py-5"><div class="container-inner"><img alt=""/></div><div class="mt-5 container-inner footer-quarter-element d-flex justify-content-between"><div class="about-edge"><p class="text-xs text-grey1 text-line-height-1-6 edge-details"></p></div><div class="footer-link-1"><ul class="text-white footer-v-nav"><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/elapage">ELA</a></li><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/life-at-edge">Life @ Edge</a></li><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/careers">Careers</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-link-2"><ul class="text-white footer-v-nav"><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/contact">Contact</a></li><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/about">About us</a></li><li class="text-line-height-1-6"><a href="/sitemap">Sitemap</a></li></ul></div><div class="social-icons"><a aria-label="facebook" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="link-no-decor"><i class="icon-facebook icon"></i></a><a aria-label="twitter" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-no-decor" target="_blank"><i class="icon-twitter icon"></i></a><a aria-label="linkedIn" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-no-decor" target="_blank"><i class="icon-linkedin icon"></i></a><a aria-label="youtube" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="link-no-decor" target="_blank"><i class="icon-youtube icon"></i></a></div></div></div><hr/><div class="py-5 container-inner footer-trio-element d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center"><div class="gartner-img"></div><div class="text-grey1 box gartner-title"><h3 class="gartner"></h3><p class="text-xs text-white"></p></div><p class="text-xxs text-grey1 box text-line-height-1-6 gartner-details"></p></div><hr/><div class="container-inner py-2 d-flex justify-content-between"><p class="text-left text-grey1 text-xxs sm-text-left m-0 py-2 md-4"></p><p class="text-right text-grey1 text-xxs sm-text-left m-0 py-2"> <!-- -->2022<!-- --> <!-- -->|<a href="/privacy"> Privacy Policy</a> | <span class="pointer">Credits</span></p></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"blogPost":{"id":544,"title":"EDGE Pathfinder - Paving The Way For An Enriching Employee Experience?","content":"\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eHi, everyone, we are in conversation with Jacob Chandy Varghese, our Head of Product \u0026amp; Engineering.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, Jacob, we will discuss EDGE EDGE Pathfinder - the industry perspective, a part of it, we've already had had a long discussion on it with Rahul, but we also want to know, your viewpoints as the product and engineering head. We will also talk about the technology part behind it and the roadmap\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Jacob, if you could, in brief, tell, tell our viewers what are the problems, that are currently faced by the industry, and how EDGE Pathfinder can be a boon for them especially in times where we are seeing an evolving workforce, and workplaces?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. At any, any time or any period of time, I think, this problem is clearly going to be there — matching the right people to the right job. So, or, in other words, the right job for the right person, the right person for the right job, both from an employee perspective, as well as an organization perspective, because everything else depends on that ‑ the happiness of the person in at work, the productivity of the organization, everything depends on this. So, I think this job to people matching is clearly a good problem to have, and it's got to be there always. So, that's the industry. And currently more so as the overall skill landscape is constantly evolving, especially in technology. Technology is just advancing at a rapid pace — it’s said that every five years, the entire skill set rolls over for the same job description. People are also at a constant effort to keep up with the trends of the industry, what are the best skills they want to have, etc. Companies are also evolving, especially in India. Globally too, the software services sector is becoming extremely popular. Why? Because everything is becoming software. Even the car you drive is now software. Tesla is nothing but the software in motion. So, everything is literally becoming software, and technology skills are just evolving continuously across whatever industry you take. So, in that kind of landscape, EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very, very interesting product for any organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow, why does it become interesting? For multiple reasons. Every organization's effort is to retain its employees. Especially the good ones who are performing well. But then, regardless of COVID, and COVID, just makes it, even more, tougher, it's very difficult for anyone in the organization to understand what the employee wants. Why? Because the career aspirations will be different. The skill landscape is evolving. And what do you keep up with? I mean, however, smarter resource manager you are, you just can't keep up with skill sets that match what the employee or employer wants. That's where EDGE Pathfinder becomes a very interesting product, for the organization — for the benefit of the employee and the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Okay. With your knowledge and experience with the product, how well do you think it is poised to solve concerns of internal fulfilment? Because see, that's not grown. That's not a huge industry, per se, because every time a resource manager or a talented acquisitor gets a requirement, the first thing they look for, is outside. Very rarely do people look inside. So how do you think it's poised to change that landscape?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. And it's a very important cost that we should play to where people don't have to look for an external job, because the organization is not able to meet their career aspiration, which is hardly the case because I mean, the reality is, every large organization has anything the employee wants, probably for a lifetime. However, the organization is not able to tap into them, the employee is not able to tap into them. Internal mobility, one of our products, actually gives the organizational perspective. So, it gives the resource manager of the organization a complete view into what are the profiles of every employee, what are their skill levels, what is their matching to the jobs which are available. So that's one view, which we already provide through our mobility product. That’s organization top down to the employee. But that's not enough. What about the employee? Now, your profile may match a demand that I have in the organization, but then that's not necessarily what you want to work on. Just because you're an expert in a certain field, doesn't mean you are eager to work in that field. I mean, we generally say that after a couple of times doing the same job, you kind of become a technology trapeze artist - you keep jumping the same loops over and over again. And you as an employee wouldn't want that. And that's where EDGE Pathfinder comes into play, even for internal fulfilment, the benefit is mutual.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, the employee looks at her skills, she has a career aspiration she defines that through our product, EDGE Pathfinder, and then looks for jobs, which are available in the organization, which takes her to that direction. Now, it may directly take her in that direction, because there is an immediately available position. Or she might see a position and say, if I do this training, because we show her what's the skill gap between what she has, versus what the job requires, she can just do training, do an assessment on the training, qualify herself and then apply, I mean, it's probably a matter of a few weeks, of just doing that. Or she might have an aspirational position, let's say, a back-end engineer wants to become a product architect. There are a couple of stops on the way. So, you can systematically work those steps. Now, through this, it is beautifully matched mutually, where the organization is still getting the internal fulfilment done but the employee is also happy. So, you are actually having a better chance of the employee being retained in the organization. Attrition also reduces, the employee is more productive in the job, billing happens, billing cycle reduces, everything gets taken care of. So, mobility from an organisational perspective, but then EDGE Pathfinder, more so from an employee perspective, gives this opportunity. And so, fulfilment naturally happens.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow, there's another problem, which most of these organizations face. People leave because they think they don't have a future in this organization. And honestly, that's not the case, EDGE Pathfinder gives transparency into that pathway, tells him you are in the right organization, you just have to look. EDGE Pathfinder gives options to the employee, you want to work in a certain domain, you want to work in a certain location, you want to work with a certain set of people, you want to be part of a certain group, you can just choose that. And then what happens, the employee stays; there is no attrition. A lot of times attrition happens because the employee is not happy, and then she starts looking out. The moment one starts looking out, your mind is gone. So, the attrition problem is also handled to some extent, that is the people who are leaving your organization for a better career opportunity can be retained in the organization.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e \u0026nbsp;This was something that I told Arjun also in our interview, that all this leads to another thing, which we could also link to recruit. But from the EDGE Pathfinder perspective, it is reducing organizational costs. Second, brand building because if there's less attrition, your brand is built. Third, if I'm giving a career graph to an employee and that employee is satisfied, and there will be more chances the employee will bring in other people; they will also increase your quality of hire.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely right. In fact, I was telling someone the other day, organizations are like an orchestra. A very good choir where, over the years when some of the core people stay then the quality of incoming people naturally increase because over time, the overall quality of the system the orchestra, the organization is improving, where the highly skilled, highly capable people are retained. And then people from outside come, everyone wants the best workplace. Hiring just becomes much easier because the word spreads. Why is this person not leaving? Oh, because he's found a career there. It really contributes even to the brand building of the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e And there's another thing that if you think of it is that a lot of times people join large organizations thinking of them as a stop-gap option. They’re like — I'll come here, I'll get training and I'll move on. I'll ask for a position, if I don't get it, I move on to another organization. However, if old employees are there, the lead is there, then they will also come in thinking that no, I have to decide if I want to stay here or not.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. See, employees are well-meaning. All of us employees, and we are all well-meaning. \u0026nbsp;Every employee is well-meaning. He or she is bothered about the career. And why would you want to leave when you have a career path and when you have people who you can learn from, and you see that they're not only staying in the organization but growing ‘like I have no reason to leave. So, things actually get taken care of. And so, you look at mature organizations, you will see people retention is a strength, while at the number level, they might have some attrition. However, if you look at the core. They stay and the core is the strength of the organization.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, Jacob, this is one part where we are able to understand how EDGE Pathfinder is helping the employee, is beneficial to the employee. Now, there are two aspects of it, which I would want your opinion on. One is how is it beneficial to the L\u0026amp;D teams within the organization? \u0026nbsp;L\u0026amp;D, R\u0026amp;D, whatever you call them, and how is it beneficial to HR?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e So, let's take L\u0026amp;D first and it is a very crucial part of the organization. EDGE Pathfinder, for instance, enables you to up your skills, so I look at a job opportunity. I see what's the skill gap. EDGE Pathfinder suggests courses. How does EDGE Pathfinder suggest the course? It’s because when we roll out EDGE Pathfinder into an organization, we integrate with the learning management system, or the learning experience system that they have. And then, it's a direct connection. Many a time the challenge of an L\u0026amp;D leader is that he or she gets asked the question, ‘Hey, listen, you're spending so much money on training the people, but then where is the benefit?’ How is it really targeted? Now, EDGE Pathfinder actually gives the L\u0026amp;D leader an opportunity to justify his or her spend on an LXP because the learning management system is fully justified because it's now connected. The employee chooses, she takes the training, she moves on her career path, she brings extra billing, she moves further on the career path, she brings a tree of billing under her, it's directly correlated. So, from an L\u0026amp;D perspective, it's a beautiful add on to whatever systems they have invested in for learning management.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eFrom an HR perspective, as I said, multiple ways. Employee satisfaction, because finally, regardless of whatever HR can imagine and do, an employee's primary happiness comes out of job satisfaction. You're happy at your work, you're learning, you're in a good team, you're a happy employee, employee satisfaction serves its core naturally. Secondly, directly it reflects on low attrition for people who you really want to retain. \u0026nbsp;And it's very naturally correlated, people who you want to retain are also people who think about their development. \u0026nbsp;And that attrition is completely reduced. And all these things improve the brand, improves your hiring capability, makes you a good place to work in any survey that you may want to run. What better do human resources, or the organization leader want? People are the strength of any organization and it's not just IT services or anything. Anywhere, people are the strength of the organization. And we enable these people to stay focused in the organization. So, it's highly beneficial to HR.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, while EDGE Pathfinder looks very deceptively, like an employee tool, which is absolutely the intention, the organization benefits much more. There's no magic to it. A happy employee makes a happy organization. The organizational benefits are just tangible, quantifiable. I mean, you just look at the faster fulfilment of a position, the billing side. You just look at reduced attrition, again, the cost saved. You just look at training at the right time, it is an investment, you are again, spending for getting better returns. So, you look at any math you want. EDGE Pathfinder makes absolutely great dollar value sense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Now we spoke about the benefits of EDGE Pathfinder. Now, if you permit, we would like to touch base with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder, and the features it has. So, let's start with the technology behind EDGE Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Right. So, the underlying of any EDGE product is the EDGE Knowledge Graph. The EDGE Knowledge Graph, our NLP based parsing capabilities, and the search and match algorithm. These are the core fundamental building blocks of any EDGE product. Right. So that still is the underlying technology, and that's our strength. And, we are always on a continuous improvement path in terms of how to really make the learning algorithm learn much more, that's our intention. Why? Because the more the learning algorithm learns about the organization, about its employees, the better suggestions we are able to throw out. So technology, fundamentally, is that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAs for features, there are multiple features, one, I wish I kept talking about, for the employee to upload her resume, connect to her social profile, LinkedIn, GitHub, or whatever; import those data into EDGE Pathfinder, so that you have a wholesome profile entered into EDGE Pathfinder within the organization. Then you can do define a career path, you can do a skill gap analysis based on that. We are integrated into the training systems, the learning management system, so she can actually take the needed pieces of training on an ongoing basis and up her skills towards the career ladder that she wants. Now, regardless of even a career ladder, sometimes they just want to try a different job. So, EDGE Pathfinder opens up the whole feature called ‘Smart jobs’, which suggests the best-fitting jobs for the employer, looks at the highest-ranked job as in where the employer has the highest match to the job description. Makes it very easy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd in that process, also you can define the employee can define certain preferences - I want to work in this domain, I want to work under certain manager, I want to work in a certain location, stuff like that. So that also gets enabled to the employee. Now, the organization doesn't have to worry at any time whether the employee is choosing something which the organization is not able to meet. That will never happen because we integrate with the policy systems of the organization. So, it's mutually harmonious stuff, where what the employer sees is what's best also, is what the organization is capable of giving. And these are the essential features of EDGE Pathfinder, which really makes it a kind of a lifetime tool for the employee in her journey.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eEDGE Pathfinder also shows some very interesting things like what are the trending skills in the organization. So, you're able to see ‘what works best' That’s also important. I mean, even though I might be good at one skill, I see that this is a trending skill. Well, I want to pick up that skill. Let me define a timeline. And I'll just pick up a few courses to some certifications. EDGE Pathfinder finally takes into account all the credentials - your resume, your career journey, your certifications. The ML algorithm takes all this into account. When we actually do a search and match it's not a rule-based one, is the machine learning algorithm-based matching, where all these aspects are taken. You may talk about a skill, and you may never know that there's a skill cluster to which it belongs, and you can jump a job within the organization by just doing an adjacency skill upgrade. So, all these things are possible through EDGE Pathfinder.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, these are I would say the core features which the employee would see. From an executive perspective, the executive can actually look at a dashboard and see what are the training skills in the organization? How many people are moving their jobs within the organization? What are the most attractive roles in the organization? What are their most attractive jobs in the organization? So, the executive dashboard actually gives the buyer a sense of his investments. And you can see that in action. \u0026nbsp;The whole dynamics of the organization is consolidated in the executive dashboards\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya\u003c/strong\u003e: With the executive board you mean, the manager or the HR head, or…\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean, the HR head, the L\u0026amp;D leader, whoever. Basically, it's role-based access. So, whoever gets access to that, at the leadership level, is not necessarily a direct manager because it's not really for the direct manager. It's for the leader of the organization. So, whoever is at the leadership level can get that, because it's a macro-level view, an aggregate view.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e So, tell me if I'm right or wrong, that it may help an employee, let's say, who's put on a 30-to-60-day, memo that your performance is not up to the mark and you need to improve? I ‘am giving a hypothetical situation here. And then that same employee is looking at his career graph and he sees some skill or a couple of skills that he or she can develop during that time period and jump on to another position within the organization. Is that also possible?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e That's possible.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I mean he may not be good for the current department, but maybe a great asset for a separate department?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Exactly. So, you're talking about a well-meaning memo and then people go through those turfs of career. Sometimes, even the smartest ones go through a trough in the career where you're just stagnating. And before you realize it, your manager tells ‘Hey, listen, you're in the wrong spot.’ Absolutely. If the person is constantly keeping in touch with EDGE Pathfinder, or if he or she can just go to EDGE Pathfinder, you can understand ‘This is where it looks like. Well, I thought I had all these skills, but all those are detrending skills.’ EDGE Pathfinder gives that view - what are the trending skills? What are the trending skills adjacent to my expertise level? Let me acquire that now. If I acquire that, what are the jobs which are available?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo absolutely, I think it's a very fair tool, a very objective tool, which is absolutely fair to the employee. So, the employee is given a second chance, I, honestly, I didn't think of that kind of use case, but then come to think of it, there are a lot of people who struggle with that in their organizations. They get lost in the whole employee base, and suddenly, they just get this information that ‘well, your skills don't make a lot of sense.’\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAbsolutely. This is why EDGE Pathfinder, honestly, is a career guide for the employee. It’s a mentor. Some of us are lucky to probably pick up the phone and ask, ‘Hey, listen, there is one job available inside the company, should I take it? Is it good?’ Not everyone is lucky to have such a mentor. EDGE Pathfinder is probably better than those mentors because a mentor is also limited by their exposure, the path that they have taken, whereas EDGE Pathfinder, powered by the EDGE Graph™ gives the whole absolute true view. In fact, much better than any human mentor, who will be away, available at a phone call.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Because a human may have his or her bias by default. So yes, it can be used as that feature also, because ultimately, it will reduce attrition. Second, it will provide the right kind of job satisfaction to that employee that I'm doing better in this role than I was doing in the other room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. You don't have to even use EDGE Pathfinder, just to shift jobs. I mean, even within that role, you can look at the skill class and keep adding on your adjacent skills. So, it's not just for internal job movement alone. It's really for your enhancement. So, which is why I said it's a, it's an ongoing guide, I mean, whoever uses EDGE Pathfinder on an ongoing basis becomes a winner anyway.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;If I could put it that way that it is very, very crucial for an organization as well as an employee. Because as I said, that if I don't have clarity on my skill sets, or where I could develop those or where my passion lies, my next job could be as futile as this one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eJacob:\u0026nbsp;Absolutely. And look at it also from an organization's point of view - it really democratizes the landscape; otherwise, it all depends on who I know. Do I know the right resource manager to find the next job? It is the complete democratization of the opportunity. And that's something which any HR leader would be proud of. It an equal opportunity that plays in its true sense.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely,\u0026nbsp;you put forth a very, very interesting point today, equality, because that is what organizations today have as their goals. And rightfully so. Equality in hiring, diversity, and things like that, I believe it can also play a very crucial role in fulfilling those kinds of objectives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yes, this is such a natural sprinkling of equality and diversity. In all the other things, the organization has to keep a mandate. It's an equal opportunity because it's available for everyone. So, I think that brings another flavour to the organization. The organization finally benefits because the right people are again in the right job. And that's our theme. In EDGE that is our theme - getting the right people onto the right jobs, right jobs for the right people. So, employee view and organization view both are met.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e And Arjun’s (our CEO) crux of keeping people at the core of every decision.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Quick last question. What is the roadmap ahead for EDGE Pathfinder?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e See, you can only improve in the way you know the employee. The success of EDGE Pathfinder lies in understanding you as an employee as you are. And that is where AI really comes into the picture in terms of what are your preferences stated or unstated? I wouldn't say unstated but subtly stated. So EDGE Pathfinder’s roadmap at a vision level is always to know the employee better, know the career landscape better and do the match. I don't have to spell out how, there are very well-established ways of doing it. If EDGE Pathfinder can know who Anannya is in her professional life, what are her interests, what are the reading interests, What are her social interactions through LinkedIn, stuff like that, you make a better suggestion for Anannya’s career. So that's really at a roadmap level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAlso, at the tactical level, we are looking at multiple aspects like integrating with the organization in a much faster way. EDGE Pathfinder, when it enters an organization is just another tool and the HR person will be like, ‘Oh, one more tool’. But that the beauty would be that EDGE Pathfinder can integrate with the ecosystem, it should ideally connect to the performance management system, but vendors should connect to, the learning system, which is already there, stuff like that. So it becomes a coherency builder in the organization. So, integrations are definitely another focus in the roadmap. So broadly speaking, I think I would limit it to that.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e Is there any feature that you may want EDGE Pathfinder to integrate in the future, something feature that is way ahead of the industry, per se right now?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJacob:\u003c/strong\u003e As I said, if I can have a clear, I wouldn't say quantitative, because that's kind of limiting. But yeah, if I can have a clear representation of the persona of the employee, in a very holistic sense. I would use the parallel, remember the days of Klout score, where everyone would be after Klout score? So, Klout score kind of gave an indication of how socially connected you are, how influential you are, are you a thought leader, are you a follower and stuff like that. I think the path of success for EDGE Pathfinder is really that, in being able to successfully personify the employee.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think the strength is in what we have already the EDGE Graph™ which is already at a very mature stage. And machine learning happens continuously and over time. So, what we have as a core is pretty precious, and the capabilities are only enhancing. So collectively, with the product and the knowledge graph and the ML core integration, I think we'll be able to come to that feature where we are clearly personifying. And then the purpose of EDGE Pathfinders will be fulfilled - showing the right career path, the right job to the employer,\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e I think it was a very, very insightful discussion, Jacob.
