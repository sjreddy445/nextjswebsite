Correlation between HR and business metrics is vital to running a high performing organization. Measuring demand and supply, skills gaps, pay and performance, utilization, attrition and retention, feedback, and even organizational network analysis – all impact business performance.  Organizations need to refocus HR deliverables on business transformation with results like cost savings, revenue generation and customer satisfaction scores.</p><p>This can be enabled by undertaking job rotation programs – moving HR resources to business and vice versa. The concept of HR Business Partners helps in being at the epicenter, allowing to contribute at a strategic level.</p><p><strong>Espouse a technology enabled, data-driven culture:</strong></p><p>Human Resources function is generating more data than ever before, and technology has enabled us to derive valuable insights from this data. Artificial intelligence-based platforms coupled with advanced analytics models are transforming the face of HR. Intelligent systems are reengineering HR processes, taking efficiency and effectiveness to a whole new level. Improved accuracy of demand and supply forecasts, reduced hiring time, better candidate matches, relevant learning recommendations, chatbot assistants for faster resolutions, optimized workforce and utilization are some of the benefits derived by adopting artificial intelligence and data science in HR.</p><p>It must be every HR leader’s priority to keep on top of latest in HR technology and use data to make smart business decisions.

This purely depends on three aspects: Budget, Scalability and Customizations required. While building custom software is expensive, the ROI makes it worthwhile. Go for it, if off-the-shelf products cannot fully meet your requirements, you have limited budgets and the scale is low. Canned solutions could be rigid and may not be compatible with existing systems in the organization that the software needs to talk to.</p><p>However, there are slew of HR technology products that are easy to use, feature rich (needing limited or no customizations) and provide excellent integration support.

Considering the quality of talent is remarkable among this sect, organizations will certainly benefit from greater speed and better output.</p><p>The trick to embracing the gig economy is mainly in change management. It requires a well thought out plan with leadership buy-in.
