rest of the world is undergoing transformation influenced by the startup boom, digital revolution and drive for innovation. We are certainly in a great position and the world is looking to us to take the lead. How do we scale up, meet skilling and hiring challenges and leapfrog? Anil Valluri &#8211; President &#8211; NetApp India &amp; SAARC shares his thoughts around all this and more. Read on…</p>
<p><strong>With India replacing Israel as the 3<sup>rd</sup> largest startup nation in the world, how do we get to being in the top 3 unicorn generators of the world?  </strong></p>
<p>My view is that we cannot set out to make Unicorns but will happen when few things come together. They happen if we are addressing a big un-addressed need of the market and a large part of the populace takes advantage of it. We in India have the benefit of making Unicorns without seeking to expand business operations outside India, due to our population. We can achieve scale without tapping global markets. The startups can stay focused and do a better job.</p>
<p><strong>What is your take on ‘open innovation’ –  where does it and doesn’t work?</strong></p>
<p>‘Open Innovation’ is the way to go for companies wanting to create new things, processes and approaches. I seriously believe in a quote once famously said by Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems that “Innovation always happens elsewhere”. That is to say that we cannot incubate innovation beyond a point and the biggest innovation is likely to come from the most unlikely places. Therefore, it is the need of every company involved in Innovation to seek idea and inputs from both inside and outside the organizations. Most of the startup acquisitions by larger companies is happening because of this phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>As a startup investor, what are some of the key factors that you consider while evaluating a startup?</strong></p>
<p>I look at the idea and its relevance to the market place in terms of addressing a real need. Scalability of the idea and its business and of course the quality and passion of the Team bringing that idea to the table. There are other things which are important like execution, sales, management etc. for which external help/mentoring can be obtained.</p>
<p><strong>How has the Indian market evolved in the last decade from skilling point of view?</strong></p>
<p>Skill is a hotly debated topic in India today due to the ‘demographic dividend’ that we keep referring to quite often. We have many people with education degrees and certificates, but their suitability to a job is quite limited. Lot of skill needs to be imparted to them before they become employable. No wonder many companies run University/College style class rooms within their organisations before they absorb them in their jobs. Definitely there is awareness and progress on the skill front. The National Skill India initiative and a dedicated Ministry for this purpose is very welcome and heartening. More fundamentally we need to strengthen our grass root education system in schools and colleges and impart them real education rather than the Rote model or the exam percentage measurement.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think NASSCOM’s Skilling India initiative help boost the employment market?</strong></p>
<p>It is definitely of use, but not sufficient for a country as large as ours. If we look at the spread and touch points for many initiatives, it is quite limited in scale. It is daunting. My belief is that we have to do more systemic changes in the school, college and exam models for us to bring about substantive change. There are also other skill areas which are not necessarily education oriented but vocational in nature. We need a large pool of them as well, if we want to sustain our development agenda. We need carpenters, plumbers, masons, mechanics, electricians and the list goes on. There is severe shortage on that front. Nation will not run if we have only software engineers.</p>
<p><strong>The proliferation of digital technologies is changing the business landscape. How do you see this impacting an organizations skills mix? How should leaders gear up to ride this wave?</strong></p>
<p>Digital transformation is happening all around us and is unstoppable. Everyone needs to learn to deal with everything being Digital! The newer generation is quite comfortable with the Digital scene but the earlier generations in an organisation are finding it difficult to adapt. But I am happy, the way India, particularly the rural populace has embraced Digital technologies, thanks largely to the Mobile phenomena. For leaders they have to deal with a different eco-system today. Meetings are virtual, attendance to office is optional, work from home is a large part of the design, 24&#215;7 work ethic is a reality, constant connectivity and round-the-clock operations put pressure on personal time and such issues. Best is to learn to adapt than resist the change. From a personal experience, I can vouch that it is going to be fun and more productive being Digital.</p>
<p><strong>What are some of the hiring related challenges that you have faced and how did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>Hiring is a constant challenge. We as leaders are invested with our emotions in hiring and from an employee standpoint, it is about the balance between emotion and opportunity. Best people are attracted to companies with great people, great culture and with an opportunity to do something substantial which can add value to their career. People usually do not change or join jobs for compensation, while it is definitely a hygiene issue. It is difficult, but important to treat employees as you would treat yourself or expect to be treated by others. Long term relationships with employees brings stability, commitment, growth and a highly productive environment.</p>
