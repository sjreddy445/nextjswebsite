class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p>The business environment is constantly changing and evolving, up-skilling helps employees keep up with the change. It involves training employees to better their already existing skills whilst teaching them new ones, making them more valuable to a business so that they can keep up with the fast-moving trends and business culture. Also, helping them to build their own market value, for better job opportunities and salary expectations.</p>
<p>Here are some tips with some SpongeBob SquarePants gifs, that will help illustrate why up-skilling is important for you and your business.</p>
<p><strong>1.Up-Skill to stay relevant</strong></p>
<p>Businesses are constantly changing, and trends are always evolving. Up-skilling and training employees can help run the business run smoothly and keep it on track with current trends. Keeping up with the latest trends is crucial in business. The business world is constantly changing and needs employees that can keep up with its fast-paced environment, otherwise you’d get left behind.</p>

<p><strong>2.Perfect what you can do</strong></p>
<p>As an employee being able to complete jobs and tasks with little to no mistakes can add value to the business. Up-Skilling can help you perfect specialized tasks and prepare you to take on more. This would lead to an increase in your efficiency and productivity.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/xT3i1d4OasIzz8E2ys" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>3.Learn something new</strong></p>
<p>Employee up-skilling and being able to accomplish various tasks, makes their business more efficient, productive and agile. Some companies are required to be agile so that they can adapt to any sudden changes in the industry that they are in. As an employee up-skilling can not only give you competitive edge but can also increase job opportunities and salary expectations.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/l4FBbk2157P8nWMqk" width="480" height="360" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>4.Keep up with digitization</strong></p>
<p>All businesses now use Artificial Intelligence (AI) to streamline various time-consuming tasks. This eliminates the time that would’ve been wasted if said tasks were done manually, giving you enough time for more strategic and creative activities rather than being caught up with monotonous jobs. Being able to work with AI and knowing how it works can give you a competitive edge over your fellow employees. Since the use of Artificial Intelligence in businesses is increasing, employers look for employees that can keep up, as such employees are likely to be of more value.</p>
<p><iframe class="giphy-embed" src="https://giphy.com/embed/3ohzAgqLRJleUNj4Lm" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>5.Add value to you</strong></p>
<p>Up-Skilling adds a lot of value to employees as it creates a highly efficient and productive workforce. Becoming well versed in various skills can add a lot of value to yourself. Employee up-skilling makes you more valuable to your business, not only because they poured in resources to train you but because you’re more efficient, productive and can contribute to more strategic jobs. It also gives you more time to think creatively which in turn can lead to innovation.</p>
