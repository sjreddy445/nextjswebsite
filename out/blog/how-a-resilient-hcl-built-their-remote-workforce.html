href="https://getedge.ai/"><strong>EDGE Networks</strong></a>, a talent management tech startup based in Bangalore, India. And it's a pleasure to be here talking to 'the' Vikas Baghel, who's one of the members of HCL Technologies, a top-three IT services company globally, has 150,000 people and gives us a complete insight into our experience of what the term supply chain is. And I think in the past, he has been one of the people I've known and, in his experience for the last 15 years, has been sort of managing through our talent supply chain, enterprise social networks, recruitment firsthand, and talent management itself. So, because of his wealth of knowledge, I've learned a lot through my journey as a startup entrepreneur through the eyes of Vikas. And I've seen him in multiple forums, contributing to making sure that you know, employees, the workforce candidates, the entire talent management company is looking to better itself at every curve. So thank you, Vikas, for being a part of this, and it's great to have you talking to us today.</p><p><strong>Vikas Baghel:</strong> Thanks for being kind. And thanks for having me here.</p><p><strong>Arjun</strong>: So, the topic of the conversation today will be, you know, the new talent equation, and I think what we are talking through is returning to the post-pandemic workplace. And I guess it's been beaten to death as to what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. All of us are waiting for the vaccine, but we still don't know what that means for many of us. And if we had to take it to the work 2.0 sort of new normal equation, what are your views on the sort of new work environment that we see today?</p><p><strong>Vikas</strong>: I think most of us have said that last year has been about a lot of realization, right, personally, as well as for the organization's I think some of the notions which we had in our head, all of us had a desire to give up from home, but we have a lot of apprehensions and inhibitions about it. One of the things is pandemic days; it cleared some of those inhibitions of some of those pilots we were running at a microscopic scale, we had to suddenly do it by force at a massive scale. And we got those results right! and all of us now realize that some of these are going to be new realities, that work from home perhaps it's going to be new reality and will not be talked as add on you're doing for employees. It will become a new normal. So, in light of doors, many of our organizations are also trying to consider how we should get back to you know if not all, perhaps 25% or 30% employees should come back to the office if they wish to. And I think that is one thing that will come as a post-pandemic trend where a lot of it will be driven by employees' desires. The whole aspect of employee experience will not be bogged down around technology, its tools, or features. It will also be about how the entire structure and the treatment of employees are going to be mated; it'll be about employee experience and the whole self of employee right, physical, financial, and mental well-being. And I think that is one thing which has changed now, earlier when we used to talk about some of these things, we were only talking about a specific section of it when we spoke about the experience with automation, technology, and all of that. However, now when we talk about experience, we are also considering aspects of financial and mental factors and health. So, I think these are some of the things and which are still early trends. But I think if the last year has been about reflection and introspection, this year will be about action for sure.</p><p>And, you know, honestly, it will give you more credit than you're taking. I think one of the things that I've seen, also through the lens of HCL, is that the fast pace not only bucks the trends but sets the pace too. So, one of the things I want to take this segue, you have been part of the employee first sort of journey. And one of the first companies that did it, at least from an India-centered standpoint, where you put the employee first in the middle of everything. And this was like, what, 15 years ago.</p><p>So when you look at the journey and look at what that means to you, I think you reflected upon it through technology, the process, automation, or a new tool that you'd give an employee. However, today, it's not about the means or the process; it's more about the engagement, the experience you're developing for them, and what are you catering to ensure that productivity is being achieved for the company as the employee. Right! So I think it's in the centre of that. The trends you see through the lens that HCL has specifically but more importantly, from your lens, because I know you speak very widely on employee engagement. How do you see the employee experience and employee engagement model fitting into a hybrid virtual work model? You do know a lot of that.</p><p><strong>Arjun: </strong>Yeah, I think so many companies have come forth and said that as soon and, you know, and I'm talking about the large corporations who have come forward and said that we are not going to get back to the pre COVID kind of walk engagement where 90% of 90 95% plus workforce are going to be in the office. Most of them have said that it will be a hybrid model because we realize that it works. There's enough data for us to show that productivity hasn't gone down. If anything, perhaps people have worked harder than ever before. And it's a personal experience as well; I'm sure it goes for you too. While we were juggling these many balls - managing the kids, parents, and household chores, we have been delivering the same productivity and, therefore, to say that getting somebody within the four walls and roof for eight hours to do work is a myth. Thus, the hybrid model will be the reality, unless you are in a kind of job or role where you're forced to be in office because of certain compliance norms or the nature of work. However, I don't think there's going to be an employer who will force people to come to the office from now on; it will be on the wheels of an employee if they want to attend office. If that's so, I think there's this other side where people say working from the office is also about connecting with the people you know; when you connect with people, perhaps you achieve more, sort things out, and brainstorm together to come up with a lot of bright and innovative ideas. While many may say the same can be done virtually, it is not the same when you are in a room sitting across from the person. There you can connect at a different level; you can see the emotions, you can see how the other person is behaving. Thus, I think some of those things will be there, and therefore, the hybrid model will be the reality, the virtual will live, and perhaps it will become 60/40. For some, it could be 70:30 - more or less, but I think the realization is there. It is going to be the new norm. As far as experience is concerned, I read this exciting report at the global trend 2020 report. And one of the fascinating data was there to say most of the seats that would consider employee experience to be a vital topic, perhaps 48 to 50% of them. But most of them do not know to say what the benefit of it is? Can the employee experience drive my business outcomes? They can't draw that line. And that's a dichotomy we live in while we understand that, okay, employee experience is essential. And we need to do something about it. But how do I draw that line to say that if I make this investment in employee experience, what will I get out of it, perhaps company output or overall productivity? And that's where people like you will come into the picture, a lot of data analytics, a lot of trend reading, that give some sort of tangible data to people and the industry to say that, yes, there will benefit out of it. And you can draw the line; I think all of us at a gut feeling level know there is a benefit. However, if somebody wants to create some model and framework around it, and you know, table it to perhaps CFOs organization to say, I need this investment. And I think that's where there is a gap today, and we need that we need somebody is helped to sort that out.</p><p><strong>Vikas: </strong>Okay, so this is an excellent point for all those startups who are sitting out there and building an effective employee engagement and an employee experience product because, for a large enterprise, it's crucial to draw the line between the ROI and employee experience. So, I think I hear you on that, because, when we go to functions that manage time and supply chain, you're at the segue of really aligning buildability, productivity to allocation and movement, including connecting train to deploy ratios to allocation, which is the same way of drawing that line. And people haven't been able to see through that, and you have this great product that does great things for employees. Hence, it's good to have, but not something that I put in as a line item as part of the annual operating plan. So I hear you on that. And this is also for all those startups out there who are building some great products to draw the line to the ROI. I've experienced it, you know, I'm a great fan of interacting with people across the table, discussion room is like glue when you're talking to people and ideas are flowing. But we don't have that availability today. And I don't know about tomorrow.</p><p>We'll have to figure it out. But we're starting to connect virtually and just make sure that we're trying to work around that missing piece. In my opinion, productivity has stayed together. Even Josh Burson cited this recently that financial security and job security are driving people to work harder, especially in the US, where there have been significant job losses to COVID and what the pandemic has done. Keeping that in mind, productivity is improved for all of us at massive levels. What does the organization benefit from in terms of a cost standpoint is lowering of cost? Is that a mantra that you see as a trend?</p><p><strong>Arjun:</strong> The operating cost has undoubtedly gone down like the travel costs, for example - there has been no travel whatsoever for the last six months. And for companies of size and scale of ours, it is a considerable cost, transportation, for example, cabs, etc., which we provide to our employee. So I think some of those are low-hanging fruits, which all the companies have plugged in more so for the companies like us, who used to work in that model, where we always balance our costs and always keep a very close watch on that. But overall, yeah, as I said, I think there is enough data like the one equal to JustPerson there are people who have done it for the APAC. And all of them have come back saying that productivity has gone up. If not, as people were, you know, doubting to say that it might go down and whatever, for whatever reason. The reason could be the fear psychosis, as you said, there could be people who see that things are not going around. The microeconomic trends are very, very, very devastating, and therefore, people perhaps are working harder than ever before for whatever reason. Still, I think it is also to do with that is one aspect. Another aspect is that most of the employees who were trusted to deliver for the company put their best effort to ensure that we stay afloat. And I think that is the emotion that drove some of those companies, and we have read enough of those stories where companies cut salaries and did well after a few quarters. After that, the wages were reinstated. And I think those are the stories that tell us that the employee and the employer who put up hands for each other, took care of each other and navigated this troublesome time. I think that's the only notion to say that the people who work with you create value for you, while people who interact with your customers/consumers are the people you empower in all aspects, financially, mentally, or physically. And they will take care of you. That's all you need to do as management, as an organization - and the rest of it, they will take care of. I read this fascinating article wherein the author said that the CEO has become a chief empathy officer. They all empathize with their employees so much, putting themselves into their shoes and enabling all those changing the policies, processes, workflows, assuring <a href="https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder"><strong>career management and development</strong></a> etc. And I think that resulted in a great for many industries. And people have come forward and collectively did great things for companies to navigate through these challenging times. And I think that's, that's a very significant change. Right? We have been talking about it, all the automation technology, and we were also talking about it to say that what will happen to human aspects if that happens? Right? And how will we balance between technology and human right, and that this is a great example, we have never seen the kind of digital disruptions we have seen in the last six months. At the same time, we have never seen the employee engagement levels of being hired in 65% 75 unheard numbers. Yeah, these kinds of numbers have never come for employee engagement and, you know, employee satisfaction. So that goes to show that you know, you can balance out both, you can have a rapid disruption of technology, automation, all of that. And you can, at the same time, you can be more human and empathetic. And as long as you can create the balance of two, you can keep moving forward. Absolutely.</p><p><strong>Vikas: </strong>And I think what you guys have done as an industry is a digitization at scale. I believe it has been one of the innovators, early adopters, in taking technology to solve parts of the process. I think many companies are looking at the model that you have and are learning. We hear from Josh that 80% of companies are going to work like professional services, consulting companies, and slash services companies. This is because everything is partly based on automotive companies operating in a pod-based model, a bank is working in a pod-based model, and banks have resource management functions today. I think that part is completely shifted, and I'm very fortunate to work in an industry that will be the next force of truth. So I've learned in that journey, and I think with that lens, I can understand what that means for, say, an oil company to change or pharmaceutical company to change looks like, as you have seen this journey, and you've seen it rapidly growing. You have also been a part of the reason digitization at scale has been achieved within your business. How do you see your employee assistance programs, for instance, as they work from home? Are you providing them with any assistance from the outside to ensure that they don't go into depression or not have issues with family, which are very personal things that we all were worried about?</p><p><strong>Arjun: </strong>Sudden for us, and we have always had that these programs. To be honest, we had this, you know, we had these counsellors who are employed. Once they can reach them at any given point in time to discuss some of those personal aspects - they can take legal help, medical health, psychological health, whatever help they need. We had these massive employee engagement programs, which used to do for the families right there. We used to host this talent show for employees and their families where children or their spouse could participate. People did institutionalize some of those programs. And we started doing these more regularly - virtually because they were going through difficult times. And mentally, it was little taxing for all of us. All the news, which we've been hearing and seeing, the numbers in all parts of the world; we needed to do something to tackle that fear psychosis that was building because of media, and news and all of that was being woven taken care of, and then the employees. So it was an overt communication in many ways, along with these engagement programs, to ensure employees and tell them to say that we are with you, and now and you'll be taken care of in any sort of eventualities. So I think, I think that has helped to a great extent. And we have been very, very proactive in our approach, we kicked our business continuity plan way back in January, I think, last week of January, we could preempt because at that point, last year, November, October, news started coming that something was happening in China and, and all of that. So I think by January, we had this realization that it could explode. So we put up a plan around it. And by the time the lockdown was announced, we were all prepared, we had all things sorted, we were ready to move on the workforce for the virtual model. Thus, we could navigate without many hiccups, not only in India but across the world.</p><p>We've been lucky, and, personally speaking, I have been driving these digital transformation projects for a while. And all of them have helped. So when we were in complete lockdown all those technologies in the workflows and the design, which we have built over the years, it just kicked in, you know, with a snap of a finger and all our recruitment got virtual - onboarding, the candidate sourcing everything went virtual. It seemed like we were doing some sort of prototype for this kind of eventuality. It all became a blessing in disguise for us. And even the adoption has gone up, suddenly, we don't need to push anything, right? All the users started adopting the technology because they had no choice; they were in that kind of environment. So overall, you know, it worked out. When all our designs and programs are always built with that kind of eventuality - horizontally, we never build anything for the short term. Whatever we have we had created, it fits well for the situation we were in as an organization. And overall, it turned out well for us.</p><p><strong>Vikas:</strong> In my view, you can redefine through the use of scrap. And I think the redefinition has been very successful because of your ability to consume technology beforehand, looking at different scenarios. And, you know Tom should have taken a leaf out of your book and done something for America. Having said that, I hope other people who are listening to it will take a leaf out of your book. I think your immediate response to the situation had been that much better since you had already played out some of these scenarios and taking into consideration some of these technologies as a path forward. So even in your thinking, just accelerating it in terms of genuine digitization at scale was really about the numbers you're playing out and the actions you're taking today because of what you've done, allowing you to do much better things going forward. So keeping that in mind, I think because a lot of aspects in terms of thinking from a strategic standpoint with talent supply chain are literally because you're taking care of 155,000 people across the board, managing them through this entire plan. In terms of the security, their purpose, their direction, and their commendable growth is something even I can't imagine. But I'm looking at 100 people in Edge and thinking about what that went through - we were going through sleepless nights, wondering what that would mean. And, you know, multiply that with the number that you have. It's just unimaginable. So hats off to you guys. The other thing that I wanted to highlight and talk about as we close this session is the gig economy and its workforce. We've heard this across that Gen Z and the millennial forming sort of the talent marketplace as we speak, and work product becoming more shorter, more short of space to how it would fit into an outcome. And there would be multiple pieces that sort of fit into the puzzle. What is that gig workforce represent to you, and how would you leverage the power of that going forward?</p><p><strong>Arjun: </strong>We employ close to this - to put the numbers 8 to 10% of our workforce will be in that mode. And as you said, going forward, perhaps that number will only grow up. Because we're not working on some of these programs, where it's taking, you know, a woman who wants to come back to work and therefore, that in the real sense, it's got to be a gig where if somebody wants to work for two hours, or three hours a day, they should have that kind of facility. And I think that's a trend in the market as well, right? If we look at, you know your hobbies a few years back, your hobby today, and if that can become your profession as well. Some people write blogs and get paid for it, some give guitar lessons and get paid for it. And I may be out here for my hobby, but today I can earn money there, Youtube is a job, right? I create a video out of my hobby, and I'm gaining because of that. So somebody is a YouTuber on Saturday, and he's an employee of a company on Monday. So I think that will be a new reality because of all the trends, platforms, and technologies that are emerging. And therefore, you will always have more and more people who would be interested in doing multiple things - I may not like to do eight hours every day, five days a week, the same thing, I would like to do some three days, I want to do something else two days, I want to do something else. And if that is the scenario, the companies have to give that kind of flexibility to their employees, right. Otherwise, you will lose out on particular adequate talent segments, which you don't want, right?</p><p>Earlier, we used to only talk about build and buy right, either you hire somebody, or you retrain/rescale somebody internally using <a href="https://getedge.ai/products/mobility"><strong>talent acquisition and management tool</strong></a>, This whole piece where you go ahead and take some of these people for a stipulated timeline to deliver your project and get done with it, is new. And then those people move on to the next assignment, and it will be a new reality. The whole aspects of those critical projects, which are short term, very time-intensive, high skilled resources, are required, which you may not need for your larger context. Sports teams where you source different players from different parts of the world create a Manchester United for a season when an EPL and then all those people go back to their countries and play their play for their countries. But just for that tournament, they get assembled as a sports professional sports team. Something like that will happen within companies, right? You will have those exceptional individual subject matter experts get together for six, eight months on a project to deliver the same in. Then they will go back to their work either within the company or outside the company. So I think the gig is gonna be the new reality because of these recent trends which are emerging. And I think most of us are still contemplating, at least in India, we are still at the stage where companies consider how I should put a framework around it? Okay, today, we are just consuming it in one pattern in one manner. Now people have started thinking to say okay because I'm not doing it at scale, I'm missing out on something. And therefore, I need to put some structure, some policy or processes around it to tap into this market.</p><p><strong>Arjun: </strong>Brilliant. So I think when in summary, I think just the analogy that you gave about Manchester United. And that's a great analogy of getting somebody to put a team together to go, and we'll win an EPL, and then sort of go back and play for your country. And I know, if I had to drop back to working in 60 odd countries, you continue to use that flavour of working. And now I'm sure, you know, for people who are going to watch this. It's about following and learning from what are the trends to manage this process going forward; there's going to be a lot of insight because if you provide through many of your interactions across social media that allow people to learn from, you know what that means for the future of work. </p><p>Thank you for a great session - it has been a pleasure as always interacting with you and picking your brain. It's been also taking time out from your busy schedule. So thank you very much.</p><p><strong>Vikas</strong>: Likewise, thanks. Thanks for having me. It's great talking to you.</p><p><strong>Arjun</strong>: Great, great. Thank you so much.

And it's a pleasure to be here talking to 'the' Vikas Baghel, who's one of the members of HCL Technologies, a top-three IT services company globally, has 150,000 people and gives us a complete insight into our experience of what the term supply chain is. And I think in the past, he has been one of the people I've known and, in his experience for the last 15 years, has been sort of managing through our talent supply chain, enterprise social networks, recruitment firsthand, and talent management itself. So, because of his wealth of knowledge, I've learned a lot through my journey as a startup entrepreneur through the eyes of Vikas. And I've seen him in multiple forums, contributing to making sure that you know, employees, the workforce candidates, the entire talent management company is looking to better itself at every curve. So thank you, Vikas, for being a part of this, and it's great to have you talking to us today.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas Baghel:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Thanks for being kind. And thanks for having me here.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun\u003c/strong\u003e: So, the topic of the conversation today will be, you know, the new talent equation, and I think what we are talking through is returning to the post-pandemic workplace. And I guess it's been beaten to death as to what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. All of us are waiting for the vaccine, but we still don't know what that means for many of us. And if we had to take it to the work 2.0 sort of new normal equation, what are your views on the sort of new work environment that we see today?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas\u003c/strong\u003e: I think most of us have said that last year has been about a lot of realization, right, personally, as well as for the organization's I think some of the notions which we had in our head, all of us had a desire to give up from home, but we have a lot of apprehensions and inhibitions about it. One of the things is pandemic days; it cleared some of those inhibitions of some of those pilots we were running at a microscopic scale, we had to suddenly do it by force at a massive scale. And we got those results right! and all of us now realize that some of these are going to be new realities, that work from home perhaps it's going to be new reality and will not be talked as add on you're doing for employees. It will become a new normal. So, in light of doors, many of our organizations are also trying to consider how we should get back to you know if not all, perhaps 25% or 30% employees should come back to the office if they wish to. And I think that is one thing that will come as a post-pandemic trend where a lot of it will be driven by employees' desires. The whole aspect of employee experience will not be bogged down around technology, its tools, or features. It will also be about how the entire structure and the treatment of employees are going to be mated; it'll be about employee experience and the whole self of employee right, physical, financial, and mental well-being. And I think that is one thing which has changed now, earlier when we used to talk about some of these things, we were only talking about a specific section of it when we spoke about the experience with automation, technology, and all of that. However, now when we talk about experience, we are also considering aspects of financial and mental factors and health. So, I think these are some of the things and which are still early trends. But I think if the last year has been about reflection and introspection, this year will be about action for sure.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd, you know, honestly, it will give you more credit than you're taking. I think one of the things that I've seen, also through the lens of HCL, is that the fast pace not only bucks the trends but sets the pace too. So, one of the things I want to take this segue, you have been part of the employee first sort of journey. And one of the first companies that did it, at least from an India-centered standpoint, where you put the employee first in the middle of everything. And this was like, what, 15 years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSo when you look at the journey and look at what that means to you, I think you reflected upon it through technology, the process, automation, or a new tool that you'd give an employee. However, today, it's not about the means or the process; it's more about the engagement, the experience you're developing for them, and what are you catering to ensure that productivity is being achieved for the company as the employee. Right! So I think it's in the centre of that. The trends you see through the lens that HCL has specifically but more importantly, from your lens, because I know you speak very widely on employee engagement. How do you see the employee experience and employee engagement model fitting into a hybrid virtual work model? You do know a lot of that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eYeah, I think so many companies have come forth and said that as soon and, you know, and I'm talking about the large corporations who have come forward and said that we are not going to get back to the pre COVID kind of walk engagement where 90% of 90 95% plus workforce are going to be in the office. Most of them have said that it will be a hybrid model because we realize that it works. There's enough data for us to show that productivity hasn't gone down. If anything, perhaps people have worked harder than ever before. And it's a personal experience as well; I'm sure it goes for you too. While we were juggling these many balls - managing the kids, parents, and household chores, we have been delivering the same productivity and, therefore, to say that getting somebody within the four walls and roof for eight hours to do work is a myth. Thus, the hybrid model will be the reality, unless you are in a kind of job or role where you're forced to be in office because of certain compliance norms or the nature of work. However, I don't think there's going to be an employer who will force people to come to the office from now on; it will be on the wheels of an employee if they want to attend office. If that's so, I think there's this other side where people say working from the office is also about connecting with the people you know; when you connect with people, perhaps you achieve more, sort things out, and brainstorm together to come up with a lot of bright and innovative ideas. While many may say the same can be done virtually, it is not the same when you are in a room sitting across from the person. There you can connect at a different level; you can see the emotions, you can see how the other person is behaving. Thus, I think some of those things will be there, and therefore, the hybrid model will be the reality, the virtual will live, and perhaps it will become 60/40. For some, it could be 70:30 - more or less, but I think the realization is there. It is going to be the new norm. As far as experience is concerned, I read this exciting report at the global trend 2020 report. And one of the fascinating data was there to say most of the seats that would consider employee experience to be a vital topic, perhaps 48 to 50% of them. But most of them do not know to say what the benefit of it is? Can the employee experience drive my business outcomes? They can't draw that line. And that's a dichotomy we live in while we understand that, okay, employee experience is essential. And we need to do something about it. But how do I draw that line to say that if I make this investment in employee experience, what will I get out of it, perhaps company output or overall productivity? And that's where people like you will come into the picture, a lot of data analytics, a lot of trend reading, that give some sort of tangible data to people and the industry to say that, yes, there will benefit out of it. And you can draw the line; I think all of us at a gut feeling level know there is a benefit. However, if somebody wants to create some model and framework around it, and you know, table it to perhaps CFOs organization to say, I need this investment. And I think that's where there is a gap today, and we need that we need somebody is helped to sort that out.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eOkay, so this is an excellent point for all those startups who are sitting out there and building an effective employee engagement and an employee experience product because, for a large enterprise, it's crucial to draw the line between the ROI and employee experience. So, I think I hear you on that, because, when we go to functions that manage time and supply chain, you're at the segue of really aligning buildability, productivity to allocation and movement, including connecting train to deploy ratios to allocation, which is the same way of drawing that line. And people haven't been able to see through that, and you have this great product that does great things for employees. Hence, it's good to have, but not something that I put in as a line item as part of the annual operating plan. So I hear you on that. And this is also for all those startups out there who are building some great products to draw the line to the ROI. I've experienced it, you know, I'm a great fan of interacting with people across the table, discussion room is like glue when you're talking to people and ideas are flowing. But we don't have that availability today. And I don't know about tomorrow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe'll have to figure it out. But we're starting to connect virtually and just make sure that we're trying to work around that missing piece. In my opinion, productivity has stayed together. Even Josh Burson cited this recently that financial security and job security are driving people to work harder, especially in the US, where there have been significant job losses to COVID and what the pandemic has done. Keeping that in mind, productivity is improved for all of us at massive levels. What does the organization benefit from in terms of a cost standpoint is lowering of cost? Is that a mantra that you see as a trend?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;The operating cost has undoubtedly gone down like the travel costs, for example - there has been no travel whatsoever for the last six months. And for companies of size and scale of ours, it is a considerable cost, transportation, for example, cabs, etc., which we provide to our employee. So I think some of those are low-hanging fruits, which all the companies have plugged in more so for the companies like us, who used to work in that model, where we always balance our costs and always keep a very close watch on that. But overall, yeah, as I said, I think there is enough data like the one equal to JustPerson there are people who have done it for the APAC. And all of them have come back saying that productivity has gone up. If not, as people were, you know, doubting to say that it might go down and whatever, for whatever reason. The reason could be the fear psychosis, as you said, there could be people who see that things are not going around. The microeconomic trends are very, very, very devastating, and therefore, people perhaps are working harder than ever before for whatever reason. Still, I think it is also to do with that is one aspect. Another aspect is that most of the employees who were trusted to deliver for the company put their best effort to ensure that we stay afloat. And I think that is the emotion that drove some of those companies, and we have read enough of those stories where companies cut salaries and did well after a few quarters. After that, the wages were reinstated. And I think those are the stories that tell us that the employee and the employer who put up hands for each other, took care of each other and navigated this troublesome time. I think that's the only notion to say that the people who work with you create value for you, while people who interact with your customers/consumers are the people you empower in all aspects, financially, mentally, or physically. And they will take care of you. That's all you need to do as management, as an organization - and the rest of it, they will take care of. I read this fascinating article wherein the author said that the CEO has become a chief empathy officer. They all empathize with their employees so much, putting themselves into their shoes and enabling all those changing the policies, processes, workflows, assuring\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/pathfinder\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecareer management and development\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;etc. And I think that resulted in a great for many industries. And people have come forward and collectively did great things for companies to navigate through these challenging times. And I think that's, that's a very significant change. Right? We have been talking about it, all the automation technology, and we were also talking about it to say that what will happen to human aspects if that happens? Right? And how will we balance between technology and human right, and that this is a great example, we have never seen the kind of digital disruptions we have seen in the last six months. At the same time, we have never seen the employee engagement levels of being hired in 65% 75 unheard numbers. Yeah, these kinds of numbers have never come for employee engagement and, you know, employee satisfaction. So that goes to show that you know, you can balance out both, you can have a rapid disruption of technology, automation, all of that. And you can, at the same time, you can be more human and empathetic. And as long as you can create the balance of two, you can keep moving forward. Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAnd I think what you guys have done as an industry is a digitization at scale. I believe it has been one of the innovators, early adopters, in taking technology to solve parts of the process. I think many companies are looking at the model that you have and are learning. We hear from Josh that 80% of companies are going to work like professional services, consulting companies, and slash services companies. This is because everything is partly based on automotive companies operating in a pod-based model, a bank is working in a pod-based model, and banks have resource management functions today. I think that part is completely shifted, and I'm very fortunate to work in an industry that will be the next force of truth. So I've learned in that journey, and I think with that lens, I can understand what that means for, say, an oil company to change or pharmaceutical company to change looks like, as you have seen this journey, and you've seen it rapidly growing. You have also been a part of the reason digitization at scale has been achieved within your business. How do you see your employee assistance programs, for instance, as they work from home? Are you providing them with any assistance from the outside to ensure that they don't go into depression or not have issues with family, which are very personal things that we all were worried about?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eSudden for us, and we have always had that these programs. To be honest, we had this, you know, we had these counsellors who are employed. Once they can reach them at any given point in time to discuss some of those personal aspects - they can take legal help, medical health, psychological health, whatever help they need. We had these massive employee engagement programs, which used to do for the families right there. We used to host this talent show for employees and their families where children or their spouse could participate. People did institutionalize some of those programs. And we started doing these more regularly - virtually because they were going through difficult times. And mentally, it was little taxing for all of us. All the news, which we've been hearing and seeing, the numbers in all parts of the world; we needed to do something to tackle that fear psychosis that was building because of media, and news and all of that was being woven taken care of, and then the employees. So it was an overt communication in many ways, along with these engagement programs, to ensure employees and tell them to say that we are with you, and now and you'll be taken care of in any sort of eventualities. So I think, I think that has helped to a great extent. And we have been very, very proactive in our approach, we kicked our business continuity plan way back in January, I think, last week of January, we could preempt because at that point, last year, November, October, news started coming that something was happening in China and, and all of that. So I think by January, we had this realization that it could explode. So we put up a plan around it. And by the time the lockdown was announced, we were all prepared, we had all things sorted, we were ready to move on the workforce for the virtual model. Thus, we could navigate without many hiccups, not only in India but across the world.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe've been lucky, and, personally speaking, I have been driving these digital transformation projects for a while. And all of them have helped. So when we were in complete lockdown all those technologies in the workflows and the design, which we have built over the years, it just kicked in, you know, with a snap of a finger and all our recruitment got virtual - onboarding, the candidate sourcing everything went virtual. It seemed like we were doing some sort of prototype for this kind of eventuality. It all became a blessing in disguise for us. And even the adoption has gone up, suddenly, we don't need to push anything, right? All the users started adopting the technology because they had no choice; they were in that kind of environment. So overall, you know, it worked out. When all our designs and programs are always built with that kind of eventuality - horizontally, we never build anything for the short term. Whatever we have we had created, it fits well for the situation we were in as an organization. And overall, it turned out well for us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;In my view, you can redefine through the use of scrap. And I think the redefinition has been very successful because of your ability to consume technology beforehand, looking at different scenarios. And, you know Tom should have taken a leaf out of your book and done something for America. Having said that, I hope other people who are listening to it will take a leaf out of your book. I think your immediate response to the situation had been that much better since you had already played out some of these scenarios and taking into consideration some of these technologies as a path forward. So even in your thinking, just accelerating it in terms of genuine digitization at scale was really about the numbers you're playing out and the actions you're taking today because of what you've done, allowing you to do much better things going forward. So keeping that in mind, I think because a lot of aspects in terms of thinking from a strategic standpoint with talent supply chain are literally because you're taking care of 155,000 people across the board, managing them through this entire plan. In terms of the security, their purpose, their direction, and their commendable growth is something even I can't imagine. But I'm looking at 100 people in Edge and thinking about what that went through - we were going through sleepless nights, wondering what that would mean. And, you know, multiply that with the number that you have. It's just unimaginable. So hats off to you guys. The other thing that I wanted to highlight and talk about as we close this session is the gig economy and its workforce. We've heard this across that Gen Z and the millennial forming sort of the talent marketplace as we speak, and work product becoming more shorter, more short of space to how it would fit into an outcome. And there would be multiple pieces that sort of fit into the puzzle. What is that gig workforce represent to you, and how would you leverage the power of that going forward?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eWe employ close to this - to put the numbers 8 to 10% of our workforce will be in that mode. And as you said, going forward, perhaps that number will only grow up. Because we're not working on some of these programs, where it's taking, you know, a woman who wants to come back to work and therefore, that in the real sense, it's got to be a gig where if somebody wants to work for two hours, or three hours a day, they should have that kind of facility. And I think that's a trend in the market as well, right? If we look at, you know your hobbies a few years back, your hobby today, and if that can become your profession as well. Some people write blogs and get paid for it, some give guitar lessons and get paid for it. And I may be out here for my hobby, but today I can earn money there, Youtube is a job, right? I create a video out of my hobby, and I'm gaining because of that. So somebody is a YouTuber on Saturday, and he's an employee of a company on Monday. So I think that will be a new reality because of all the trends, platforms, and technologies that are emerging. And therefore, you will always have more and more people who would be interested in doing multiple things - I may not like to do eight hours every day, five days a week, the same thing, I would like to do some three days, I want to do something else two days, I want to do something else. And if that is the scenario, the companies have to give that kind of flexibility to their employees, right. Otherwise, you will lose out on particular adequate talent segments, which you don't want, right?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEarlier, we used to only talk about build and buy right, either you hire somebody, or you retrain/rescale somebody internally using\u0026nbsp;\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/products/mobility\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etalent acquisition and management tool\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, This whole piece where you go ahead and take some of these people for a stipulated timeline to deliver your project and get done with it, is new. And then those people move on to the next assignment, and it will be a new reality. The whole aspects of those critical projects, which are short term, very time-intensive, high skilled resources, are required, which you may not need for your larger context. Sports teams where you source different players from different parts of the world create a Manchester United for a season when an EPL and then all those people go back to their countries and play their play for their countries. But just for that tournament, they get assembled as a sports professional sports team. Something like that will happen within companies, right? You will have those exceptional individual subject matter experts get together for six, eight months on a project to deliver the same in. Then they will go back to their work either within the company or outside the company. So I think the gig is gonna be the new reality because of these recent trends which are emerging. And I think most of us are still contemplating, at least in India, we are still at the stage where companies consider how I should put a framework around it? Okay, today, we are just consuming it in one pattern in one manner. Now people have started thinking to say okay because I'm not doing it at scale, I'm missing out on something. And therefore, I need to put some structure, some policy or processes around it to tap into this market.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArjun:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eBrilliant. So I think when in summary, I think just the analogy that you gave about Manchester United. And that's a great analogy of getting somebody to put a team together to go, and we'll win an EPL, and then sort of go back and play for your country. And I know, if I had to drop back to working in 60 odd countries, you continue to use that flavour of working. And now I'm sure, you know, for people who are going to watch this. It's about following and learning from what are the trends to manage this process going forward; there's going to be a lot of insight because if you provide through many of your interactions across social media that allow people to learn from, you know what that means for the future of work.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThank you for a great session - it has been a pleasure as always interacting with you and picking your brain. It's been also taking time out from your busy schedule. So thank you very much.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVikas\u003c/strong\u003e: Likewise, thanks. Thanks for having me.
