Though things are looking better the road to recovery is still foggy.</p><p>The WorldWorld has changed forever. The last time the economy took such a brutal beating was in 2008. However, analysts predict that the economic backlash caused by COVID-19 will be far more significant. For the first time in history, the value of a single barrel of crude oil dipped below the USD 1 mark.  </p><p>Yet, as the saying goes, ‘This too shall pass. Just like how the crude oil market self-corrected its value overnight, so will the global economy. Once the potency of the virus declines and vaccines begin to hit the market, organisations and enterprises will need to swing back into action.  </p><p>But we must remember that with such a trenching impact on the economy, jobs and working conditions will never be the same again. Skills will evolve, redundant roles will get axed, and the automation of repetitive tasks will forge the way forward.  </p><p>This doesn’t translate into a loss of jobs but more of an evolution. So, how will organisations cope with the gradual shift in working conditions and requirements so as to efficiently hire for the Future of Work?  </p><p><strong>Planning and Forecasting</strong> </p><p>Enterprises will need to start arriving at the idea of Talent Decisioning with a more holistic approach.  </p><p>HR leaders will need to be more aware of the market and understand how businesses, projects and goals have changed. By understanding how a client’s business requirements have changed, the talent pipeline will also have to be modified to source the right individual for a job.  </p><p>Evaluating skills required, skills present within the organisation, project requirements, client goals etc., will become much more critical whilst seeking new talent.  </p><p><strong>Career Sites</strong> </p><p>An important yet often ignored facet of HR Technology is the requirement for robust career sites.  A dedicated career site helps an organisation by tackling two defenders at the same time! </p><p>The platform serves as an internal repository of information pertaining to the workforce’s skills, experience and overall performance metrics. A robust career site ensures employees regularly update the platform with the necessary skills. And with an added layer of intelligence, the platform can deduce skill gaps and make relevant up-skilling/re-skilling to ensure employees start imbibing skills for the incoming requirements.  </p><p>The second facet of the Career Site is that it helps in <a href="https://edgenetworks.in/">Workforce Optimization</a>. Hiring managers can access relevant profiles with just a few clicks, thereby fulfilling open positions internally. It reduces the overall cost to hire (C2H) and helps in employee career progression.  </p><p>It is essential to know that adequate career progression reduces overall employee attrition.  </p><p><strong>Enhance Recruitment with Technology</strong> </p><p>Technology in the field of recruitment has existed for years, but it has to go beyond the rudimentary ATS (Application Tracking System).  </p><p>Sifting through hundreds of resumes, shortlisting and marking them to the Talent Acquisition team has always been tedious, resulting in hours of workforce wasted.  </p><p>HR Technology was born when HR applications began adding a layer of intelligence with the help of AI and Machine Learning (ML).
