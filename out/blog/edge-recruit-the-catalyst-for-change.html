We are in conversation with Neha Chauhan, our Product Manager for EDGE Recruit &amp; Mobility. She talks about EDGE Recruit - our latest offering, how the team stumbled upon the idea for the exciting product &amp; gives a sneak-peek at its features.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> Welcome Neha. For the uninitiated, she is our go-to person for EDGE Recruit. So, without wasting any more time, we'll get on to understanding the various aspects of the product. Also, we would be really interested to know how the team &amp; business leaders harped upon the idea of EDGE Recruit?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Neha Chauhan:</strong> Sure, so I'll take you back to how he started his journey. We started by matching internal employees to the job openings within an organization. And that is a journey, we continued for a little while. And it was eventually search-and-match that we were doing; we had the jobs in hand, we knew what the job is asking for, we had employees on the other hand, and we could match those employees to the candidates. We soon realized that this concept of search and match does not remain constricted to just internal employees; the same could be applied to the external market. And that's when we tried to filter it off to external markets by matching the same job instead of employees, the external candidates. And that is the idea that eventually developed for EDGE Recruit. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">While we were good at search-and-match, this is the journey that continued for us for a little while. A couple of years back, we tried to rehash what we were doing so far until now. So, while we were really good at what we were doing until now, i.e. search-and-match, we realized that this is just one small part of the entire problem. There are a lot of other issues that are still lying unsolved in the whole recruitment function or the recruitment cycle. If you look at it, recruiters, on average, get about 400 applications, which can go to 10,000 or so. For a human to sit and go through all those resumes is an impossible task. And that's why you keep hearing those keywords 'make your resume catchy'. Frankly, people glance at it; you have three seconds to catch their attention. You are not the only applicant. There are 1000 more people like you. If I put myself in the recruiter's shoe, that is the best they can do. Either they can go about going through those 1000 resumes in a linear fashion one-by-one, or they would randomly pick up the resumes or something. If something is interesting, it is prioritized. Now, in that entire day of work, you would tend to lose some excellent candidate that was matching your requirement and was not at a high cost.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">There is no way for you to figure out in one glance who is the best among those 1000. How do I even prioritize? And that's what we provide. We provide a stack ranked list of candidates by matching those 1000s of candidates to one job in just seconds. The recruiter has to review each profile no longer to understand what all skills they have, is good or bad, to match the job at hand. All that task is done and presented to them readily, to see who out of those 1000 are the best match to the job. But this, too, is solving just one part of the problem. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">When you look at the entire recruitment cycle, you have to source the candidates from multiple job boards and screen them. After that, you need to check everybody's availability to get the interview scheduled. There are numerous systems involved where a recruiter will have to go and update their status, keeping so many people in the loop, including the candidates. This entire process in itself has a lot of problems. And that's where almost two years back, we started our user discovery session to give a fresh look at what we were doing so far and how we can improve. We spoke to CHROs of Fortune 10 companies, hundreds of recruiters in IT/ITes services, our existing clients, and the other ones. And those user interviews are what helped us in realizing the gamut of problems that lie in this space and how this entire function had transformed over the past few years when we started our product journey.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, those user interviews are something that helped us in identifying the problem statements. I had my own hypothesis, my own theories laid out. I wanted to ensure that my understanding of the problem statement or my idea is what I wanted to validate with the actual users, which are the recruiters. This is the cycle that went on for quite a reasonable amount of time and for a very long time, dwelling in the problem space to figure out all the problems that lie in this entire recruitment cycle and the problems we're solving for. In the first version, we cannot solve everything, but I have tried to solve the product key problems that I figured out from all of these interviews.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> And so, you know, as you said, this is version 1 of the product that we're launching now. So, what were those features that you thought of when incepting EDGE Recruit? And how has it changed today? What new features have been added, and what features can we expect in days to come?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Neha Chauhan:</strong> One of the key value propositions of EDGE Recruit is the ability to source from multiple job board's. So each of these organizations has their repository of different resumes that they have collected over the course of the period, either to career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves going and getting some resumes. So there is a repository that they have, but you can think of it as more or less just a database, which was never maintained. You would find my resume lying in there, which was years and years old. So it's no more applicable. If you look at that resume, it will no more apply to the job you must be looking for. So when you have a job in hand, all you're trying to, as a recruiter, do is try to find the candidates who can fulfil this position. Now there are multiple sources through which you can find out those candidates. You would first start with your own talent pool - your own repository of data, which has its challenges presently. It's not maintained, it's ancient, you wouldn't have updated information, even the candidates' contact information is unavailable maybe, and so on. The next step is to figure out where to find the candidates, and then you go about who to contact. Now, even in the market, there are multiple job boards. And for a recruiter to go about doing that, they will have to go log in individually to each of the job boards, figure out who all the matching candidates for the requirement and have all of that information consolidated somewhere in an excel or something right. So that is an overburden on the recruiter. So you don't have to go to multiple job boards trying to figure out the candidates. From our application itself, you can auto source candidates from job boards directly so that you will eventually never run out of CVs. You can keep on increasing and improving your talent pool through this auto sourcing. Of course, you will never run out of talent pool; you have the entire market available for you to explore through this auto sourcing.</p><p>One of the other key features that I would want to discuss is how the recruiter's KPIs and the parameters they are judged upon. So one of the KPIs is employee referral because they are pushed towards fulfilling a maximum number of positions coming in through employee referral. Now, that cycle is also somewhere broken in a sense; when an employee would refer their friend or someone against a particular job. And that is just a one-time opportunity. It could be hit or miss for that person. If the referral matches the job, you're through. If not, your resume goes in vain. Nobody else will look at your resume after that to figure out that this person, although referred for this one job, has better opportunities that he/she may be able to fulfil in the organization. So, why can't I take the person's resume and see if this person matches some other job? And it might turn out that we have a better opportunity for this person than something that they applied for.  </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So we provide this reverse matching as well, where one part of the flow is you have a job in hand, and you're just trying to find the matching candidates for that job. The other way around is also possible; you have a resume in hand, and it looks good. It might not be a good fit for the job you have presently, because as a recruiter, your visibility is restricted to few jobs that match your own. But if I have this resume on the system, and there's an ability for me to figure out that this person fits ten other jobs, why can't I proceed with this resume for those other jobs. It helps recruiters meeting their own KPIs and fulfilling positions for the employer. And even actual data says that there is a higher possibility of closure, of any candidate eventually even joining you if it's coming through an employee referral. Otherwise, in this entire scheme of things, a candidate might end up not joining you after making you wait for 60 or 90 days of the notice period, which to an extent is solved if it's through an employer because the confidence is already in place for your organization when it's coming through an employer. And that's precisely why even organizations that try to push for employee referrals above other categories are going in the market and trying to find resumes. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are a few more exciting features that we have introduced, and I'll take a minute to talk about those particular ones. So one thing being ours is an AI system. And we genuinely believe that any candidate, if they are to be screened, should be filtered based on their skill sets' quality and experience. Nothing else matters. With this tool, we are trying to take care of the unintentional or unconscious bias that may creep in while looking at a particular candidate's profile. We are trying to take. It could be anything - gender, liking towards a specific organization etc. A candidate coming from a great organization might create an unconscious bias towards favouring a particular candidate. However, there might be another candidate equally or even better than this specific profile. So in this tool itself, we provide means for you to tackle the unconscious as that may come in screening and ensure that a candidate's screening process is limited or is happening only through their qualifications and experiences, nothing else. Diversity and inclusion programs are people promised visions who want to deliver upon right now.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> It is gaining ground these days everybody's talking about. It's a company on vision these days to maintain that. Yeah, it's a very, very important part.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Neha Chauhan:</strong> Absolutely. I mean, precisely the need of the hour as well. It is necessary. The women representation, in particular, and has to increase, and it's great that it's two of us talking over here for this interview. So through EDGE Recruit, we all want to help recruiters and help the organization meet their diversity and inclusion goals. It could be gender, people with special needs, or veteran status etc. So whatever an organization's diversity goals, our product is configurable to meet their specific requirements.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> Is there anything else you would want to add to this. Are there any features that were probably thought about but not implemented in this version? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Neha Chauhan:</strong> I can give you a brief, not in terms of features, but what we have in our roadmap and how we are thinking to solve the recruitment cycle in full. We aim to help recruiters with resume screening and interest check emailers, candidate management or interview scheduling. We are thinking from wide angles, across different stages of the recruitment cycle, and how to solve them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> So, it's like behold, a lot is coming in. Till now, we were talking about EDGE Recruit as a product, its features and how it's going to help recruiters. Now, we'll speak of it in terms of business impacts. What are the business impacts it will bring for organizations? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Neha Chauhan: </strong>To answer this, I will categorize three organizational goals we are trying to target - time, cost, and quality. The time it takes for you to hire or close a position, the cost you are hiring for a particular position, and the quality of hire you're bringing into your organization. Time and cost are understandable, and everyone talks about those, but I will specifically talk about the quality of hire. How are we intending towards improving the quality of hire? So, we're adding AI algorithms to assist the recruiter in assessing a candidate by providing just-in-time insights that they may have missed and are critical for the particular position in hand. So, we experimented a lot and figured out that performance capability can be assessed through social grouping. When I say social grouping we are currently looking at GitHub and StackOverflow. Your entire scope of evaluating a particular candidate so far has remained restricted to just their resume. It is their impression in a snapshot, nothing else beyond that. And if you look at it, there are many different areas where people showcase their capabilities.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">GitHub and Stack Overflow are the top two sites that I would go to for developers. GitHub came to India in 2018-19, I think. And by 2020, they had more than 1.8 million developers who joined GitHub. As for their estimations, by 2023, like nearly two years later, they expect there will be 10 million developers who would have joined GitHub. And India, for them, is one of the fastest-growing markets. There may be many projects and activities that the developers would do or have had a repository of at GitHub and Stack Overflow. So, within the product, we intend to provide a view of all that a person does, even beyond their resume. We fetch all that information, activities, etc., and give a recruiter a picture of what they're doing beyond the usual. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">This, in turn, helps in validating what the resume is. Nothing stops a candidate to declare what they want in their resume. But when you can see proof of the same in the activities that a particular person has been doing, it helps you validate and be confident that this person poses what they claim to be. Suppose all of those are taken care of in the earlier stages - during a screening. In that case, your probability of taking many people over to the interview stages and then falling on the numbers drastically, would also decrease. The reason being you will be proceeding only with the candidates who you believe are really true to their word. And have the capability to clear the interviews, right. The funnel that exists right now is very heavy until the interview scheduling and then suddenly drops. With this in place, the funnel will be tight from the beginning stages itself until the hiring.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya Debnath:</strong> Thank you Neha. We got a lot of insights about the product. I think whatever we've spoken here is really going to help us push EDGE Recruit to the other level. So, thank you so much for your time.

We are in conversation with Neha Chauhan, our Product Manager for EDGE Recruit \u0026amp; Mobility. She talks about EDGE Recruit - our latest offering, how the team stumbled upon the idea for the exciting product \u0026amp; gives a sneak-peek at its features.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Welcome Neha. For the uninitiated, she is our go-to person for EDGE Recruit. So, without wasting any more time, we'll get on to understanding the various aspects of the product. Also, we would be really interested to know how the team \u0026amp; business leaders harped upon the idea of EDGE Recruit?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Sure, so I'll take you back to how he started his journey. We started by matching internal employees to the job openings within an organization. And that is a journey, we continued for a little while. And it was eventually search-and-match that we were doing; we had the jobs in hand, we knew what the job is asking for, we had employees on the other hand, and we could match those employees to the candidates. We soon realized that this concept of search and match does not remain constricted to just internal employees; the same could be applied to the external market. And that's when we tried to filter it off to external markets by matching the same job instead of employees, the external candidates. And that is the idea that eventually developed for EDGE Recruit.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhile we were good at search-and-match, this is the journey that continued for us for a little while. A couple of years back, we tried to rehash what we were doing so far until now. So, while we were really good at what we were doing until now, i.e. search-and-match, we realized that this is just one small part of the entire problem. There are a lot of other issues that are still lying unsolved in the whole recruitment function or the recruitment cycle. If you look at it, recruiters, on average, get about 400 applications, which can go to 10,000 or so. For a human to sit and go through all those resumes is an impossible task. And that's why you keep hearing those keywords 'make your resume catchy'. Frankly, people glance at it; you have three seconds to catch their attention. You are not the only applicant. There are 1000 more people like you. If I put myself in the recruiter's shoe, that is the best they can do. Either they can go about going through those 1000 resumes in a linear fashion one-by-one, or they would randomly pick up the resumes or something. If something is interesting, it is prioritized. Now, in that entire day of work, you would tend to lose some excellent candidate that was matching your requirement and was not at a high cost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere is no way for you to figure out in one glance who is the best among those 1000. How do I even prioritize? And that's what we provide. We provide a stack ranked list of candidates by matching those 1000s of candidates to one job in just seconds. The recruiter has to review each profile no longer to understand what all skills they have, is good or bad, to match the job at hand. All that task is done and presented to them readily, to see who out of those 1000 are the best match to the job. But this, too, is solving just one part of the problem.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhen you look at the entire recruitment cycle, you have to source the candidates from multiple job boards and screen them. After that, you need to check everybody's availability to get the interview scheduled. There are numerous systems involved where a recruiter will have to go and update their status, keeping so many people in the loop, including the candidates. This entire process in itself has a lot of problems. And that's where almost two years back, we started our user discovery session to give a fresh look at what we were doing so far and how we can improve. We spoke to CHROs of Fortune 10 companies, hundreds of recruiters in IT/ITes services, our existing clients, and the other ones. And those user interviews are what helped us in realizing the gamut of problems that lie in this space and how this entire function had transformed over the past few years when we started our product journey.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, those user interviews are something that helped us in identifying the problem statements. I had my own hypothesis, my own theories laid out. I wanted to ensure that my understanding of the problem statement or my idea is what I wanted to validate with the actual users, which are the recruiters. This is the cycle that went on for quite a reasonable amount of time and for a very long time, dwelling in the problem space to figure out all the problems that lie in this entire recruitment cycle and the problems we're solving for. In the first version, we cannot solve everything, but I have tried to solve the product key problems that I figured out from all of these interviews.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;And so, you know, as you said, this is version 1 of the product that we're launching now. So, what were those features that you thought of when incepting EDGE Recruit? And how has it changed today? What new features have been added, and what features can we expect in days to come?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;One of the key value propositions of EDGE Recruit is the ability to source from multiple job board's. So each of these organizations has their repository of different resumes that they have collected over the course of the period, either to career sites, employer profiles, or recruiters themselves going and getting some resumes. So there is a repository that they have, but you can think of it as more or less just a database, which was never maintained. You would find my resume lying in there, which was years and years old. So it's no more applicable. If you look at that resume, it will no more apply to the job you must be looking for. So when you have a job in hand, all you're trying to, as a recruiter, do is try to find the candidates who can fulfil this position. Now there are multiple sources through which you can find out those candidates. You would first start with your own talent pool - your own repository of data, which has its challenges presently. It's not maintained, it's ancient, you wouldn't have updated information, even the candidates' contact information is unavailable maybe, and so on. The next step is to figure out where to find the candidates, and then you go about who to contact. Now, even in the market, there are multiple job boards. And for a recruiter to go about doing that, they will have to go log in individually to each of the job boards, figure out who all the matching candidates for the requirement and have all of that information consolidated somewhere in an excel or something right. So that is an overburden on the recruiter. So you don't have to go to multiple job boards trying to figure out the candidates. From our application itself, you can auto source candidates from job boards directly so that you will eventually never run out of CVs. You can keep on increasing and improving your talent pool through this auto sourcing. Of course, you will never run out of talent pool; you have the entire market available for you to explore through this auto sourcing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of the other key features that I would want to discuss is how the recruiter's KPIs and the parameters they are judged upon. So one of the KPIs is employee referral because they are pushed towards fulfilling a maximum number of positions coming in through employee referral. Now, that cycle is also somewhere broken in a sense; when an employee would refer their friend or someone against a particular job. And that is just a one-time opportunity. It could be hit or miss for that person. If the referral matches the job, you're through. If not, your resume goes in vain. Nobody else will look at your resume after that to figure out that this person, although referred for this one job, has better opportunities that he/she may be able to fulfil in the organization. So, why can't I take the person's resume and see if this person matches some other job? And it might turn out that we have a better opportunity for this person than something that they applied for. \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo we provide this reverse matching as well, where one part of the flow is you have a job in hand, and you're just trying to find the matching candidates for that job. The other way around is also possible; you have a resume in hand, and it looks good. It might not be a good fit for the job you have presently, because as a recruiter, your visibility is restricted to few jobs that match your own. But if I have this resume on the system, and there's an ability for me to figure out that this person fits ten other jobs, why can't I proceed with this resume for those other jobs. It helps recruiters meeting their own KPIs and fulfilling positions for the employer. And even actual data says that there is a higher possibility of closure, of any candidate eventually even joining you if it's coming through an employee referral. Otherwise, in this entire scheme of things, a candidate might end up not joining you after making you wait for 60 or 90 days of the notice period, which to an extent is solved if it's through an employer because the confidence is already in place for your organization when it's coming through an employer. And that's precisely why even organizations that try to push for employee referrals above other categories are going in the market and trying to find resumes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere are a few more exciting features that we have introduced, and I'll take a minute to talk about those particular ones. So one thing being ours is an AI system. And we genuinely believe that any candidate, if they are to be screened, should be filtered based on their skill sets' quality and experience. Nothing else matters. With this tool, we are trying to take care of the unintentional or unconscious bias that may creep in while looking at a particular candidate's profile. We are trying to take. It could be anything - gender, liking towards a specific organization etc. A candidate coming from a great organization might create an unconscious bias towards favouring a particular candidate. However, there might be another candidate equally or even better than this specific profile. So in this tool itself, we provide means for you to tackle the unconscious as that may come in screening and ensure that a candidate's screening process is limited or is happening only through their qualifications and experiences, nothing else. Diversity and inclusion programs are people promised visions who want to deliver upon right now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;It is gaining ground these days everybody's talking about. It's a company on vision these days to maintain that. Yeah, it's a very, very important part.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Absolutely. I mean, precisely the need of the hour as well. It is necessary. The women representation, in particular, and has to increase, and it's great that it's two of us talking over here for this interview. So through EDGE Recruit, we all want to help recruiters and help the organization meet their diversity and inclusion goals. It could be gender, people with special needs, or veteran status etc. So whatever an organization's diversity goals, our product is configurable to meet their specific requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Is there anything else you would want to add to this. Are there any features that were probably thought about but not implemented in this version?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;I can give you a brief, not in terms of features, but what we have in our roadmap and how we are thinking to solve the recruitment cycle in full. We aim to help recruiters with resume screening and interest check emailers, candidate management or interview scheduling. We are thinking from wide angles, across different stages of the recruitment cycle, and how to solve them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, it's like behold, a lot is coming in. Till now, we were talking about EDGE Recruit as a product, its features and how it's going to help recruiters. Now, we'll speak of it in terms of business impacts. What are the business impacts it will bring for organizations?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNeha Chauhan: \u003c/strong\u003eTo answer this, I will categorize three organizational goals we are trying to target - time, cost, and quality. The time it takes for you to hire or close a position, the cost you are hiring for a particular position, and the quality of hire you're bringing into your organization. Time and cost are understandable, and everyone talks about those, but I will specifically talk about the quality of hire. How are we intending towards improving the quality of hire? So, we're adding AI algorithms to assist the recruiter in assessing a candidate by providing just-in-time insights that they may have missed and are critical for the particular position in hand. So, we experimented a lot and figured out that performance capability can be assessed through social grouping. When I say social grouping we are currently looking at GitHub and StackOverflow. Your entire scope of evaluating a particular candidate so far has remained restricted to just their resume. It is their impression in a snapshot, nothing else beyond that. And if you look at it, there are many different areas where people showcase their capabilities.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eGitHub and Stack Overflow are the top two sites that I would go to for developers. GitHub came to India in 2018-19, I think. And by 2020, they had more than 1.8 million developers who joined GitHub. As for their estimations, by 2023, like nearly two years later, they expect there will be 10 million developers who would have joined GitHub. And India, for them, is one of the fastest-growing markets. There may be many projects and activities that the developers would do or have had a repository of at GitHub and Stack Overflow. So, within the product, we intend to provide a view of all that a person does, even beyond their resume. We fetch all that information, activities, etc., and give a recruiter a picture of what they're doing beyond the usual.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis, in turn, helps in validating what the resume is. Nothing stops a candidate to declare what they want in their resume. But when you can see proof of the same in the activities that a particular person has been doing, it helps you validate and be confident that this person poses what they claim to be. Suppose all of those are taken care of in the earlier stages - during a screening. In that case, your probability of taking many people over to the interview stages and then falling on the numbers drastically, would also decrease. The reason being you will be proceeding only with the candidates who you believe are really true to their word. And have the capability to clear the interviews, right. The funnel that exists right now is very heavy until the interview scheduling and then suddenly drops. With this in place, the funnel will be tight from the beginning stages itself until the hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya Debnath:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Thank you Neha.
