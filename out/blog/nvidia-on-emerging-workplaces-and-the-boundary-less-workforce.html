The Boundary-less Workforce</b></div></div></div><div class=" mt-5 row"><div class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> Tell us a bit of yourself, share your experiences</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> Like, I mentioned earlier, working from home for over a year has given us all an opportunity to rediscover and reimagine ourselves. So, with over 25 years in the HR industry, pretty much most of my professional career has been with two companies, Intel &amp; NVIDIA. I joined the organization when it was a fledgling company with a lot of ambition to establish a global footprint. I've been with them for 15 years now, managing the India region, which comprises India and Southeast Asia, &amp; is the largest engineering presence for NVIDIA outside of the US, close to around 3000 direct employees &amp; 1500 contractors. I manage the entire HR group for the region.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Additionally, I also play the role of a site leader who is the cultural ambassadors and the fishery keepers for the organization. So, I manage it for Bangalore, which is the largest site that we have in India. And clearly, the last year or so has been transformational for us. We reimagined &amp; reinvented.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> That's amazing. Are you introducing some theatrical production stuff as part of your cultural change? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> We actually are. We are typically a very, very serious tech kind of a company, very work-focused. And we believe that people derive joy from work. But in the last year, we've actually put together a set of programs that helps employee's kind of showcase their talents. And, incredibly, there are so many hidden gems and lost skills in the company that we were not even aware of. It's been a successful initiative since the human side of the enterprise has come to the forefront. It's impressive to see how leaders have become a lot more transparent and a lot more palpable as human beings, as against just people who were kind of setting direction and energizing people to accomplish business outcomes. But it's incredible to see the personal side of the leaders across the company as well. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> How have the employees in the region you govern coped with the pandemic from a personal, professional and workplace level? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> I think it happened in two phases. I think, when it started off, there was an element of crisis that had kind of hit the organization and the employees. And people were trying to figure out how they make sure that they continue to deliver to the expectations. And I think there was a little bit of heroism that was kind of coming in, right, which is that people thought it's a crisis, they need to go above and beyond. And they were actually kind of getting to a stage where they were in a crash and burn mode. Right. And I think the way I look at it that roughly around a quarter, into it people realize that this is not kind of going to go away. And it is not the time for going above and beyond. But it's about making the adjustments needed to kind of acclimatize yourself to the new way of working. Some people were burning out in the initial stages. They weren't infrastructure constraints they were dealing with - they were kind of trying to grapple with managing the personal crisis, as well as their desire to kind of continue to find meaning in what they do from a professional perspective. But I think they have now gotten used to the new normal. Obviously, as a company, we have kind of created an enabling environment as well.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We told them not to worry about the deliverables work and take care of themselves or your family. That is a priority. And we kind of extended to the level where we said we don't want even our contingent workers and partners to get impacted. So we decided where we want to pay everybody at the level it is, and they don't need to be worried from a financial perspective. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">The employees of today have a potent social conscience; they're not only looking at in terms of what you're doing to them. But what you're doing to the larger ecosystem as well. Secondly, we pulled in our increment cycle really fast, assuring our employees that we are there for them. The third thing was that very quickly, we enabled them from an infrastructure perspective. They were ID packs that were kind of built-in in record time and were shipped to employees' homes, which meant that they had all the infrastructure needed to get productive. We quickly introduced a $400 subsidy for people to buy furniture from home to create the right economic environment office environment.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">So I think these helped to nurture a lot of confidence. Lastly, we made our top leadership a lot more visible. We had virtual visits from our CEO &amp; the entire leadership team together communicating 'we are in this together. These things helped us create what I would call an environment of comfort, which was very well received and well appreciated.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> Now, yeah, that is amazing to hear. Because as they say, it's difficult times when humanity comes out. So, I think the social contract that all of us have with each other shows up in these kinds of times. And I think it's it did, in all the cases that you talked about. From the perspective of NVIDIA being a tech company, did you face the situations of needing to rescale, retrain &amp; understand what works, what doesn't work from a talent perspective? How has that changed, if at all, for you?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> Actually, it's not changed significantly for us, other than the fact that now we have a much larger universe to kind of work in. And, it is actually a boundaryless world as far as talent is concerned. And that's a massive plus for us. Most technology companies, including ours, are highly innovative and research-focused but have not had the building blocks to allow employees to work from home. I think the concept was not alien to us.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">What has changed dramatically is the way work is kind of getting done now. Culture is a big challenge that most of us have. How do you ensure that your culture is experienced by the employees currently operating in a remote kind of environment, especially when we hire more people than we've ever done? In the last year, even if I look from an Indian perspective, our hiring has gone up by 30% from what we've done in the past. From a business perspective, we are getting into new areas, expanding ourselves. A skill set, for instance, that we built over the last year is in the networking space because data centres are a big focus area for us. Over the previous 12 months, we've actually made more investments in newer areas than we've ever done before as well. We looked at it as an opportunity where we could reimagine, re-explore and actually reinvent a lot of the things that we were doing. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our hiring has gone virtual. For so many years now, we were trying to, you know, kind of, get technology adoption when it came to recruiting people. We had middling success, I would say. In the last 12 months, I think we have made giant strides in everything that happened; our platforms have gone virtual, the adoption of technology and tools and predictive assessment tools have just kind of gone through the roof. In these 12 months, what we've learned is that that's the easiest part? You no longer have the resistance, you no longer have the criticism, you no longer have a fear of trying something new. And, you know, for instance, I mean, our entire college hiring was done virtually through tools like hacker ranks and some of the other technologies that we're using. It actually broke down some of our deep-rooted construction behaviour that organizations have that the best talent. And we were able to expand our reach efficiently, and instead of having five IDs and 10 NIDs, we could reach out to 120 colleges at the same time, and roughly half of the talent that we hired actually didn't come in from those colleges. And it was a massive paradigm shift for our managers, as well, who said that you know, let's not kind of just focus on the conventional ways of doing things, and let's kind of get a little more unconventional, and there is a goodness to it as well. So, I think many of our paradigms have taken a shift in the last 10 months or so. And change management has never been easier. Digital adoption, self-service models - most companies' kind of struggle with it. And we are not behind because we have a very, very intimate manager centric, employee-centric approach.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> No, I get that. So now there is obviously a side to it, where the getting feedback in-person feedback, the engagement in, in physical terms used to be kind of the norm earlier? How do you see that play out? You might have gone through reviews and feedback cycle? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> Employee surveys are dead. Pile surveys are the way to kind of go forward. We are now doing very, very quick, short pulse surveys every two months. And we are doing it on a thematic basis. Right. In terms of trying to understand what is on top of people's minds. For instance, our first survey was about how you kind of looking at work from home, and what is it that is, what is your confidence level in terms of coming back to work? And what would make you more comfortable? And there were some interesting perspectives that kind of came in there; a lot of people said that I don't mind kind of coming to work, but I'm really, really kind of concerned about the well-being of my family. And my second most significant concern is whether my co-workers are going to adhere to the new working norms. So, it's not about me, I'm confident I'll be able to do whatever you're asking me to do, or whatever I know the government was telling me, but I'm not too sure that my co-workers will be doing that. It was also very, very clear to us that people are saying that we want to kind of, we want to kind of come back in phases. And perhaps the future is that I would 60% of our employees said that I don't see myself coming into work more than two to three days a week for a few hours, and make it more focused and make it more thoughtful as against just coming to work because I am expected to kind of come to work.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Surprisingly, you realize the millennials and the younger employees are more interested in coming back to work because they were missing the social connection. They want to come back to work because work-office &amp; social interaction is a big part of life. I don't think people are going to be wanting to work from anywhere. I think they will want to work from the location and may not be necessarily from the office. So, there's a lot more flexibility that's going to kind of come in there. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Our second poll survey was about collaboration and saying as to whether collaboration is working. There was some intense feedback that came in there saying that keep the business running kind of stuff, things that I'm already doing well. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Employees are missing interacting with co-workers. They make one-on-one conversations, but that informal, inorganic way of just kind of shooting the breeze is kind of missing. On our end, however, ideation is becoming a challenge. Whenever it comes to new ideas, new projects, we are struggling with that. We're still trying to figure out what's the best way to create that. There are obviously virtual tools to assist some of that brainstorming, whiteboarding, all of that. However, people want what I call shooting the piece, right? Kind of seeing the other person's reaction, the body language makes a big part of how work is done. They are also missing their informal coaching and mentoring, you know, that thing that hey, if I'm stuck with something, something I just walk over to somebody, I get it resolved, and I move on with my life. Today, I have to kind of make a deliberate effort to kind of set up a call, do a meeting, the type of stuff, but it is interesting, right? The way I look at it, you know, three significant shifts that I have experienced are the shift from employee experience that companies are focused on to kind of managing what I call the employee life experience now.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit: </strong></i>Three significant shifts that I have experienced are the change from employee experience to employee life experience, understanding the challenges around parenting, life challenges, and finding ways to help them address them. Mental wellness, a psychological hub in India, our utilization of that has just kind of gone through the muscle gone through the roof. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> Absolutely.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong> </i>Initially in India, you know, people are very, very sceptical to say, hey, if I go to an employee assistance program, there is something wrong with me. Now, that actually kind of look into it as a very, very meaningful tool to kind of help them cope with their life scenarios. The definition of work-life balance has changed dramatically. It's no longer about work-life balance is about work-life integration. Traditionally, it was about giving flexibility to people to kind of work from home. Now people are looking at flexibility in terms of time.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">We had to kind of go and reconfigure all our meeting ecosystem and eliminate many of our meetings. So, I think that the whole concept of work-life is undergoing a shift. I think the other thing that has been significant learning for us, and I think at a macro level, will have implications in the future as well. That I think countries, regions, states, cities are no longer going to be focused on attracting companies to come to their core to them. And the emphasis is going to be in terms of attracting talent to come to them.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Also, I think managers are learning new skills as well. Empathy &amp; mindfulness is something that is a unique trait that they would they are being forced to kind of develop. So suddenly, the appetite for behavioural programs, and a lot of managers, you know, have this kind of a little bit of trepidation when it comes to soft skills sort of training has gone up tremendously. And people wanted short, they wanted personalized, and they wanted contextual. So, storytelling will be the most critical skill that the leaders are going to want to need. And empathy is probably the most prominent skill that the managers would have to learn in the future, and I think we got no easy answers for this; I think all of us are kind of learning as we go along. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Technology adoption, I think, again, is a given at this point in time, and we're probably going to see a lot more a lot quicker adoption of tools and technologies than we've ever done in the past.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">Recruiting is a low hanging fruit that's already kind of accelerated. Learning and development will follow as well because it's going to become hyper-personalized, almost like the retail shopping experience kind of stuff. And we are going to be required to sort of change the way we kind of deliver training and the kind of training that we do because people are not interested in looking at general principles. They are looking at more contextual stuff. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Service providers would also have to look at how they will make their offerings customized - a lot more flexible and a lot more relevant to clients as against having a big platform that can tweak a little bit here and there. So, these are the big things that we are kind of seeing now.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> You referred to the advantages of the boundaryless workforce that you can access now. Within that, obviously, there is this whole gig workforce concept that is playing out as well. In this boundary-less environment, it gives you a more significant opportunity to tap into talent across the VDI environment and your contingent workforce environment unlocked by location. So how is that helping you? And also, from a talent perspective, helping your talent tap into roles and jobs in different parts of the world for them? Right? Is that something which you've seen pick up?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Amit:</strong></i> It's a mixed bag. I am a little worried because it also means that there will be a higher propensity for the US and Europe to start hiring from India. And, as the talent truly kind of, I mean, it's a reality that we would have to kind of contend with. And in some ways, it's a challenge because then we need to sort of up-level our game to make sure that the work that we do is equally meaningful and equally attractive. After all, increasingly, we see that many companies, the US, have now started to hire people from India for jobs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">And, and in some cases, they're paying them US salaries as well. So that's, yeah, that's something that we would have to kind of contend with. I think the other thing that companies must be cautious about is that there are still legal and compliance issues that companies have to deal with as you get people to work from home. It's not that easy for me to kind of get somebody to work from a restaurant. I mean, it looks great. But if he's using my hardware, it kicks in, for instance, some GST implications for us? How will personal taxation kind of work? I think it's more pronounced in the Western world, but increasingly, in India, how do I make sure that I am compliant with the local laws? And in India, we do have a federal structure where each state has its own employment laws. But having said that, I think if I look at the talent behaviour, they have become a lot more open. I hired more people in Delhi last year than I have done in the previous 10 years. Because, you know, it was challenging for us to move people from Delhi. And then suddenly people are kind of attracted by the quality of work by the quality of organization that they're going to be going to work in, under location does not become a significant factor as well. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">However, I think the gig stuff will probably take a little more time to pick up. I think it's still pretty nascent at this point in time. From an Indian perspective, there is a little bit of trepidation. How do I kind of make sure that the person is working for us in the limited time they are working for us, they're giving their 100% kind of totally committed because it's not about just the technical skills? The biggest challenge for companies is the expansion of the skills that you require from your workforce. The more significant trend is re-skilling employees, taking people from their specialized zones and converting them into full-stack. And I think that's the biggest challenge that most organizations would have. And therefore, putting in programs, bringing in technology that understands what the skill map in the company is going to become a significant, big imperative. And I think a lot of us are kind of struggling with it now. And I know your company has some solutions there.</p><p style="text-align:justify;">I think it's a sweet spot at this point in time. It's not external looking. It's not about where the talent lies outside. It is where the skill lies within the company. And how do you kind of utilize that? And with the barriers of location, time zones being removed, I think it's like a huge opportunity, a significant imperative for organizations in terms of how to identify what your skill landscape is and how to do you kind of leverage the underutilized talent within the organization. And I think creating those skill inventories, understanding where they're skill-wise, and how best you can sort of leverage it, and create opportunities for them to do to bring their best to work, I think is going to be big.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><i><strong>Suranjan:</strong></i> Great.

So, with over 25 years in the HR industry, pretty much most of my professional career has been with two companies, Intel \u0026amp; NVIDIA. I joined the organization when it was a fledgling company with a lot of ambition to establish a global footprint. I've been with them for 15 years now, managing the India region, which comprises India and Southeast Asia, \u0026amp; is the largest engineering presence for NVIDIA outside of the US, close to around 3000 direct employees \u0026amp; 1500 contractors. I manage the entire HR group for the region.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAdditionally, I also play the role of a site leader who is the cultural ambassadors and the fishery keepers for the organization. So, I manage it for Bangalore, which is the largest site that we have in India. And clearly, the last year or so has been transformational for us. We reimagined \u0026amp; reinvented.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;That's amazing. Are you introducing some theatrical production stuff as part of your cultural change?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;We actually are. We are typically a very, very serious tech kind of a company, very work-focused. And we believe that people derive joy from work. But in the last year, we've actually put together a set of programs that helps employee's kind of showcase their talents. And, incredibly, there are so many hidden gems and lost skills in the company that we were not even aware of. It's been a successful initiative since the human side of the enterprise has come to the forefront. It's impressive to see how leaders have become a lot more transparent and a lot more palpable as human beings, as against just people who were kind of setting direction and energizing people to accomplish business outcomes. But it's incredible to see the personal side of the leaders across the company as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;How have the employees in the region you govern coped with the pandemic from a personal, professional and workplace level?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;I think it happened in two phases. I think, when it started off, there was an element of crisis that had kind of hit the organization and the employees. And people were trying to figure out how they make sure that they continue to deliver to the expectations. And I think there was a little bit of heroism that was kind of coming in, right, which is that people thought it's a crisis, they need to go above and beyond. And they were actually kind of getting to a stage where they were in a crash and burn mode. Right. And I think the way I look at it that roughly around a quarter, into it people realize that this is not kind of going to go away. And it is not the time for going above and beyond. But it's about making the adjustments needed to kind of acclimatize yourself to the new way of working. Some people were burning out in the initial stages. They weren't infrastructure constraints they were dealing with - they were kind of trying to grapple with managing the personal crisis, as well as their desire to kind of continue to find meaning in what they do from a professional perspective. But I think they have now gotten used to the new normal. Obviously, as a company, we have kind of created an enabling environment as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe told them not to worry about the deliverables work and take care of themselves or your family. That is a priority. And we kind of extended to the level where we said we don't want even our contingent workers and partners to get impacted. So we decided where we want to pay everybody at the level it is, and they don't need to be worried from a financial perspective.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe employees of today have a potent social conscience; they're not only looking at in terms of what you're doing to them. But what you're doing to the larger ecosystem as well. Secondly, we pulled in our increment cycle really fast, assuring our employees that we are there for them. The third thing was that very quickly, we enabled them from an infrastructure perspective. They were ID packs that were kind of built-in in record time and were shipped to employees' homes, which meant that they had all the infrastructure needed to get productive. We quickly introduced a $400 subsidy for people to buy furniture from home to create the right economic environment office environment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo I think these helped to nurture a lot of confidence. Lastly, we made our top leadership a lot more visible. We had virtual visits from our CEO \u0026amp; the entire leadership team together communicating 'we are in this together. These things helped us create what I would call an environment of comfort, which was very well received and well appreciated.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Now, yeah, that is amazing to hear. Because as they say, it's difficult times when humanity comes out. So, I think the social contract that all of us have with each other shows up in these kinds of times. And I think it's it did, in all the cases that you talked about. From the perspective of NVIDIA being a tech company, did you face the situations of needing to rescale, retrain \u0026amp; understand what works, what doesn't work from a talent perspective? How has that changed, if at all, for you?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Actually, it's not changed significantly for us, other than the fact that now we have a much larger universe to kind of work in. And, it is actually a boundaryless world as far as talent is concerned. And that's a massive plus for us. Most technology companies, including ours, are highly innovative and research-focused but have not had the building blocks to allow employees to work from home. I think the concept was not alien to us.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWhat has changed dramatically is the way work is kind of getting done now. Culture is a big challenge that most of us have. How do you ensure that your culture is experienced by the employees currently operating in a remote kind of environment, especially when we hire more people than we've ever done? In the last year, even if I look from an Indian perspective, our hiring has gone up by 30% from what we've done in the past. From a business perspective, we are getting into new areas, expanding ourselves. A skill set, for instance, that we built over the last year is in the networking space because data centres are a big focus area for us. Over the previous 12 months, we've actually made more investments in newer areas than we've ever done before as well. We looked at it as an opportunity where we could reimagine, re-explore and actually reinvent a lot of the things that we were doing.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOur hiring has gone virtual. For so many years now, we were trying to, you know, kind of, get technology adoption when it came to recruiting people. We had middling success, I would say. In the last 12 months, I think we have made giant strides in everything that happened; our platforms have gone virtual, the adoption of technology and tools and predictive assessment tools have just kind of gone through the roof. In these 12 months, what we've learned is that that's the easiest part? You no longer have the resistance, you no longer have the criticism, you no longer have a fear of trying something new. And, you know, for instance, I mean, our entire college hiring was done virtually through tools like hacker ranks and some of the other technologies that we're using. It actually broke down some of our deep-rooted construction behaviour that organizations have that the best talent. And we were able to expand our reach efficiently, and instead of having five IDs and 10 NIDs, we could reach out to 120 colleges at the same time, and roughly half of the talent that we hired actually didn't come in from those colleges. And it was a massive paradigm shift for our managers, as well, who said that you know, let's not kind of just focus on the conventional ways of doing things, and let's kind of get a little more unconventional, and there is a goodness to it as well. So, I think many of our paradigms have taken a shift in the last 10 months or so. And change management has never been easier. Digital adoption, self-service models - most companies' kind of struggle with it. And we are not behind because we have a very, very intimate manager centric, employee-centric approach.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;No, I get that. So now there is obviously a side to it, where the getting feedback in-person feedback, the engagement in, in physical terms used to be kind of the norm earlier? How do you see that play out? You might have gone through reviews and feedback cycle?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Employee surveys are dead. Pile surveys are the way to kind of go forward. We are now doing very, very quick, short pulse surveys every two months. And we are doing it on a thematic basis. Right. In terms of trying to understand what is on top of people's minds. For instance, our first survey was about how you kind of looking at work from home, and what is it that is, what is your confidence level in terms of coming back to work? And what would make you more comfortable? And there were some interesting perspectives that kind of came in there; a lot of people said that I don't mind kind of coming to work, but I'm really, really kind of concerned about the well-being of my family. And my second most significant concern is whether my co-workers are going to adhere to the new working norms. So, it's not about me, I'm confident I'll be able to do whatever you're asking me to do, or whatever I know the government was telling me, but I'm not too sure that my co-workers will be doing that. It was also very, very clear to us that people are saying that we want to kind of, we want to kind of come back in phases. And perhaps the future is that I would 60% of our employees said that I don't see myself coming into work more than two to three days a week for a few hours, and make it more focused and make it more thoughtful as against just coming to work because I am expected to kind of come to work.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSurprisingly, you realize the millennials and the younger employees are more interested in coming back to work because they were missing the social connection. They want to come back to work because work-office \u0026amp; social interaction is a big part of life. I don't think people are going to be wanting to work from anywhere. I think they will want to work from the location and may not be necessarily from the office. So, there's a lot more flexibility that's going to kind of come in there.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eOur second poll survey was about collaboration and saying as to whether collaboration is working. There was some intense feedback that came in there saying that keep the business running kind of stuff, things that I'm already doing well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eEmployees are missing interacting with co-workers. They make one-on-one conversations, but that informal, inorganic way of just kind of shooting the breeze is kind of missing. On our end, however, ideation is becoming a challenge. Whenever it comes to new ideas, new projects, we are struggling with that. We're still trying to figure out what's the best way to create that. There are obviously virtual tools to assist some of that brainstorming, whiteboarding, all of that. However, people want what I call shooting the piece, right? Kind of seeing the other person's reaction, the body language makes a big part of how work is done. They are also missing their informal coaching and mentoring, you know, that thing that hey, if I'm stuck with something, something I just walk over to somebody, I get it resolved, and I move on with my life. Today, I have to kind of make a deliberate effort to kind of set up a call, do a meeting, the type of stuff, but it is interesting, right? The way I look at it, you know, three significant shifts that I have experienced are the shift from employee experience that companies are focused on to kind of managing what I call the employee life experience now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003eThree significant shifts that I have experienced are the change from employee experience to employee life experience, understanding the challenges around parenting, life challenges, and finding ways to help them address them. Mental wellness, a psychological hub in India, our utilization of that has just kind of gone through the muscle gone through the roof.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;Absolutely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/i\u003eInitially in India, you know, people are very, very sceptical to say, hey, if I go to an employee assistance program, there is something wrong with me. Now, that actually kind of look into it as a very, very meaningful tool to kind of help them cope with their life scenarios. The definition of work-life balance has changed dramatically. It's no longer about work-life balance is about work-life integration. Traditionally, it was about giving flexibility to people to kind of work from home. Now people are looking at flexibility in terms of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eWe had to kind of go and reconfigure all our meeting ecosystem and eliminate many of our meetings. So, I think that the whole concept of work-life is undergoing a shift. I think the other thing that has been significant learning for us, and I think at a macro level, will have implications in the future as well. That I think countries, regions, states, cities are no longer going to be focused on attracting companies to come to their core to them. And the emphasis is going to be in terms of attracting talent to come to them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAlso, I think managers are learning new skills as well. Empathy \u0026amp; mindfulness is something that is a unique trait that they would they are being forced to kind of develop. So suddenly, the appetite for behavioural programs, and a lot of managers, you know, have this kind of a little bit of trepidation when it comes to soft skills sort of training has gone up tremendously. And people wanted short, they wanted personalized, and they wanted contextual. So, storytelling will be the most critical skill that the leaders are going to want to need. And empathy is probably the most prominent skill that the managers would have to learn in the future, and I think we got no easy answers for this; I think all of us are kind of learning as we go along.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eTechnology adoption, I think, again, is a given at this point in time, and we're probably going to see a lot more a lot quicker adoption of tools and technologies than we've ever done in the past.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eRecruiting is a low hanging fruit that's already kind of accelerated. Learning and development will follow as well because it's going to become hyper-personalized, almost like the retail shopping experience kind of stuff. And we are going to be required to sort of change the way we kind of deliver training and the kind of training that we do because people are not interested in looking at general principles. They are looking at more contextual stuff.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eService providers would also have to look at how they will make their offerings customized - a lot more flexible and a lot more relevant to clients as against having a big platform that can tweak a little bit here and there. So, these are the big things that we are kind of seeing now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;You referred to the advantages of the boundaryless workforce that you can access now. Within that, obviously, there is this whole gig workforce concept that is playing out as well. In this boundary-less environment, it gives you a more significant opportunity to tap into talent across the VDI environment and your contingent workforce environment unlocked by location. So how is that helping you? And also, from a talent perspective, helping your talent tap into roles and jobs in different parts of the world for them? Right? Is that something which you've seen pick up?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAmit:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;It's a mixed bag. I am a little worried because it also means that there will be a higher propensity for the US and Europe to start hiring from India. And, as the talent truly kind of, I mean, it's a reality that we would have to kind of contend with. And in some ways, it's a challenge because then we need to sort of up-level our game to make sure that the work that we do is equally meaningful and equally attractive. After all, increasingly, we see that many companies, the US, have now started to hire people from India for jobs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eAnd, and in some cases, they're paying them US salaries as well. So that's, yeah, that's something that we would have to kind of contend with. I think the other thing that companies must be cautious about is that there are still legal and compliance issues that companies have to deal with as you get people to work from home. It's not that easy for me to kind of get somebody to work from a restaurant. I mean, it looks great. But if he's using my hardware, it kicks in, for instance, some GST implications for us? How will personal taxation kind of work? I think it's more pronounced in the Western world, but increasingly, in India, how do I make sure that I am compliant with the local laws? And in India, we do have a federal structure where each state has its own employment laws. But having said that, I think if I look at the talent behaviour, they have become a lot more open. I hired more people in Delhi last year than I have done in the previous 10 years. Because, you know, it was challenging for us to move people from Delhi. And then suddenly people are kind of attracted by the quality of work by the quality of organization that they're going to be going to work in, under location does not become a significant factor as well.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eHowever, I think the gig stuff will probably take a little more time to pick up. I think it's still pretty nascent at this point in time. From an Indian perspective, there is a little bit of trepidation. How do I kind of make sure that the person is working for us in the limited time they are working for us, they're giving their 100% kind of totally committed because it's not about just the technical skills? The biggest challenge for companies is the expansion of the skills that you require from your workforce. The more significant trend is re-skilling employees, taking people from their specialized zones and converting them into full-stack. And I think that's the biggest challenge that most organizations would have. And therefore, putting in programs, bringing in technology that understands what the skill map in the company is going to become a significant, big imperative. And I think a lot of us are kind of struggling with it now. And I know your company has some solutions there.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eI think it's a sweet spot at this point in time. It's not external looking. It's not about where the talent lies outside. It is where the skill lies within the company. And how do you kind of utilize that? And with the barriers of location, time zones being removed, I think it's like a huge opportunity, a significant imperative for organizations in terms of how to identify what your skill landscape is and how to do you kind of leverage the underutilized talent within the organization. And I think creating those skill inventories, understanding where they're skill-wise, and how best you can sort of leverage it, and create opportunities for them to do to bring their best to work, I think is going to be big.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003ci\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuranjan:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/i\u003e Great.
