class=" mt-5 row"><div class="col"><span class="text-sm"><p>They buy their groceries online, get news about the world from Facebook, and prefer YouTube over television! These digital natives experience more of their lives online than any generation before them, particularly through social networks &#8211; and literally live their lives on their smartphones.</p>
<p>So, who are ‘they?’ They are the <em>millennials,</em> and guess what &#8211;  right now, they are the largest part of our workforce today.</p>
<p>That’s solid reason why organisations must think of ways to integrate this generation into their existing workforces. HR, in particular, must play a significant role in preparing both the millennials and the organisation to gel and work well with each other.</p>
<p>However, many companies stumble in their understanding of how millennials are different from any other generation in the workforce till now.  Here are some useful hints that will surely help you:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Exposure to Technology</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>No other generation is as comfortable using technology as the millennials are. They are heavy consumers of technology and use it to manage or conduct almost every aspect of their lives – including work. This also implies that they are used to fast processes and immediate or instant results.</p>
<p><strong><em>What organizations need to do</em></strong><em>:</em> For your tech-savvy millennials consider reinventing business operations and processes to make them smartphone-enabled as well as intuitive. They drive pretty much everything through technology – so make sure you implement ‘Bring Your Own Device’ (BYOD) policy at the workplace to make them feel at-home and productive!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Social Mindset</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A millennial without multiple social media accounts would probably be classified a mythical creature, or an anomaly! They share their thoughts, emotions, ideas and frustrations freely on social media. This behavioral trait can be a great opportunity for HR to get to know employees better, and establish a meaningful connect</p>
<p><strong><em>What organizations need to do</em></strong><em>:</em> Consider building an internal organization-wide social platform or a robust intranet with social apps. Many other social or messaging tools like Yammer, Slack, Wikis, Wrike and Google Docs or Microsoft Office365 are easily available today which enable collaboration the social way. Organizations could also check out private groups on networks like Facebook or LinkedIn and see if millennials adopt it.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Education vs learning</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>We aren’t just talking about text book knowledge, college degrees, or classroom education any more. The millennials believe in learning via many different channels. Thanks to the internet and social media, millennials are exposed to a huge pool of knowledge, experts, discussions and thinking.</p>
<p><strong><em>What organizations need to do</em></strong><em>:</em> First off, broaden your definition of knowledge and skills. Consider implementing advanced tools like Intelligent Learning Path (ILP) to help millennial employees self-manage their learning and career goals. Larger companies should also evaluate and integrate Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) as part of their Learning and Development programs to help millennials enhance their knowledge of various subjects.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Dialogue and feedback</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Millennials tend to have high self-esteem, but they also seek regular feedback to shape their careers and achieve faster professional growth. An annual review meeting probably won’t interest a millennial; monthly or quarterly feedback sessions is what might do the trick for them. Also, a simple ‘good job’ or ‘I really appreciate your ideas’ will go a long way in motivating this group.</p>
<p><strong><em>What organizations need to do</em></strong><em>:</em> Implement changes in HR processes to better meet the motivational needs of millennials as research shows that regular feedback, encouragement and recognition matter a lot to them. The gamification of HR appraisal and feedback processes, informal coffee or lunches with managers, fun R&amp;R programs can be the focus areas for HR going forward.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li><strong>Engaging in new ways</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>It has been said that no generation before has been as easily distracted as the millennials, and we always have the ubiquitous smartphone to blame! If boredom kills productivity, the millennials get bored easily and instinctively reach to surf their smartphone. But HR needs to engage with millennials in ways suited to their style and pace.</p>
<p><strong><em>What organizations need to do</em></strong><em>:</em> Focus on creating unique employee engagement programs using technology and data analytics. Millennials also love challenges; and their job roles must be carefully designed to offer challenging and fulfilling opportunities. Artificial Intelligence for example can help HR write better job descriptions, study employee skills, ensure they gel with the company culture and design more versatile roles for employees, resulting in more fulfilling careers.</p>
<p>Let’s not forget that millennials have been the drivers behind multiple workplace changes, increasingly demanding perks such as flexible working, career advancement and constant feedback – but they’re often stuck with the “entitled” label which isn’t necessarily fair.</p>
<p>Organizations also need to adopt a nuanced human capital strategy; and adapt themselves to the unique cultural traits of this generation by embracing flexible working hours, encouraging intrapreneurship and regular crowd sourcing of ideas and opportunities from the younger professionals.</p>
<p>Only then can we truly leverage the diversity of a workforce, and work toward enhanced productivity and satisfaction.</p>
