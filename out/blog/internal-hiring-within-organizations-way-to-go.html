There is a growing need to understand more ways to achieve internal talent mobility than simply filling a role with a current employee. According to LinkedIn’s 2018 Workforce Learning Report, nearly 95 per cent of employees feel that they would remain with the existing company if it made an investment in their careers. This opens up a peripheral opportunity for organizations to increase employee retention and bolster the reskilling process while taking a holistic approach to the organization’s needs.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">As organizations reimagine today’s talent journey, they’re putting greater emphasis on employee experience.

They all exist in different capacities but in isolation.

Built on our Smart AI EDGE GraphTM - an astute knowledge graph, which has analyzed over 10 million job descriptions and 35 million candidate profiles, EDGE Pathfinder puts the employee in the centre and simplifies employee engagement. It helps HR teams and employees with auto-filled, standardized, consolidated profiles of all the employees. Based on employee profile information, EDGE Pathfinder recommends the best internal jobs for which the employee is eligible.
