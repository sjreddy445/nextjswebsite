I have come to learn about people, faith and friendship, and most importantly the meaning of change. From a fledgling to its current state, I have seen the evolution of an idea to execution, with moments of extinction in between. Starting a company in India, building and selling products and solutions to the Indian customer are an unparalleled experience. The most important facet of my learning is the people that build our team, the soul of the entity we call EdGE Networks, a myriad of hope, expression, want and fulfilment. It is this passion and soulful energy that I wake to every morning of the week and begin a beautiful, bright day. Thank you people, thank you friends and family, thank you all for having the guts to walk through the door and be a part of a new beginning.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePriyadarshi Lahiri, Head- Technology, says, “I have been at EdGE now for 3 years.

It has been an extremely exciting journey building a platform that has the potential to define Recruitment and Workforce Optimization 2.0 from how enterprises see it today. Building trust with our customers, building a great application, the data science team innovating to create better offerings, and serving our customers better is what has kept me and my team busy and we have loved every moment of it.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreat going, EdGE Networks!

Take up the role of ‘talent scout’ for internal and external talent\u003cbr /\u003e\nWith the talent shortage today, it is critical that CHROs are able to spot pools of talent the organisation needs by using both intuition and insight backed by data and assessment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e5.

Especially for businesses in dire need of a competitive edge, it\u0026#8217;shard to overstate the excitement and possibilities that such a wealth of information offers. That being said, big data is only as useful as it is properly wielded, and the question of how to wield it isn\u0026#8217;t always easily answered. If your business has already embraced the promise of big data, here are seven ways you can still use it better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1. Better Reports\u003cbr /\u003e\nBig data is supposed to mean better data, but if you and your employees can\u0026#8217;t organize it and ingest it in a way that yields greater efficiency and a more robust bottom line, what use is it? One key to using big data better is to make sure that what\u0026#8217;s collected can be properly disseminated, and the generation of better reports can do that for you. With reporting software from companies like Windward, you can embed document and report generation into whatever big data harvesting software you\u0026#8217;re using so you and your team can see what\u0026#8217;s being gathered and what it means more clearly and more quickly.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2. Better Insight\u003cbr /\u003e\nAnother way in which your company can probably use big data better is in the achievement of better insight. The insight you need from big data depends in large part on the type of work you do. Understanding your customer base better in order to more effectively target them for direct mail campaigns is only useful if you use direct mail. Big data has to be tailored and fine tuned in each instance of its use, or the insight it promises you may not be as applicable as it could be.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e3. Better Customer Experience\u003cbr /\u003e\nGone are the days when customers wanted good customer service; now, they want that and a host of other pro-customer experiences. Let big data help you craft a better customer experience by ensuring that every time someone interacts with your brand, you not only know about it, but you can understand the positives and the negatives of each interaction well enough to more effectively manage them. Customer experience is about the lifetime of a person\u0026#8217;s experience with a brand or business. Let big data help you know about and craft each one.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e4. Better Speed\u003cbr /\u003e\nIt isn\u0026#8217;t enough to move faster than your competitors if your movement isn\u0026#8217;t in the right direction. With big data, it can be tempting to let every little insight equal a quick jump onto every bandwagon, but doing so is missing the point. Let the speed at which you can now make decisions be more about wisdom than about quickness. Because you can now know more than you ever have in a shorter amount of time, let that truth yield decision-making that is of the highest quality. Better-utilized and applied speed — not more of it — is key.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?ssl=1\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1547\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?resize=300%2C240\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"image 1_1\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" data-wp-pid=\"1547\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?resize=300%2C240\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/image-1_1.jpg?w=733\u0026amp;ssl=1 733w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n5. Better Integration\u003cbr /\u003e\nIs IT still a separate department or idea at your business? It\u0026#8217;s time for those walls to come down. Technology is no longer it\u0026#8217;s own, separate offering that assists business here and there. Like it or not, technology is synonymous with the language in which business happens, and the faster you integrate that reality into the framework of how your company functions, the better. Don\u0026#8217;t let big data be something your IT department tackles and sends memos about. From marketing and HR to sales and supply chain, big data needs to be fully integrated into everything you do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e6. Better Accuracy\u003cbr /\u003e\nTrying to improve accuracy is a misguided quest that largely misses what big data can offer you. Accuracy is more about asking the right questions of big data than it is about ensuring that the data you\u0026#8217;re getting is right. Improve your accuracy by knowing more specifically what you\u0026#8217;re after. Too many businesses assume big data knows what they need. It doesn\u0026#8217;t. You do. Ask the right questions, and you\u0026#8217;ll get better and more accurate answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e7. Better Nuance\u003cbr /\u003e\nNuance is where big data can truly shine. In the past, executives prided themselves on their people skills and intuition as guides that gave them a competitive advantage, and while intuition and the ability to \u0026#8220;read\u0026#8221; others are invaluable skills in life and business, big data isn\u0026#8217;t empathetic. Data-driven at its core and in its application, the nuance offered by big data can be hard to trust, because it\u0026#8217;s still so far outside the realm of most business people\u0026#8217;s experience. Don\u0026#8217;t balk. Let the nuance that\u0026#8217;s presented exist as nuance, and treat it as the finely honed, data-driven knowledge it is.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn business, the question is no longer: Should I use big data? The question is how. Follow these seven suggestions, and use big data in a better way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSource: http://www.smartdatacollective.com/tiffanyrowe/347847/7-ways-your-business-can-use-big-data-better\u003c/p\u003e\n","slug":"7-ways-your-business-can-use-big-data-better","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003eBig data offers insight that can, at times, seem almost god-like in its breadth, depth, and application.

He became fascinated with how small adjustments in ways managers interact with their workforces could change financial outcomes. “It’s very much like changing a financial portfolio: We change the portfolio of our people,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn 2009, Milnor launched a team at Chevron to deliver key performance indicators (KPIs) and tools requested by HR, such as headcounts, attrition rates and dashboards. The team has since more than doubled in size and shifted its orientation from basic reporting and KPIs toward business questions faced by executives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat led to creation of a workforce analytics center of excellence (CoE) consisting largely of project managers and analysts — generalists who gather data and build dashboards. Nowadays, the 15-person CoE maintains a “workstream” on workforce planning and advanced analytics staffed by specialists in attrition, hiring and employee surveys. “The very narrow focus allows them to knock out reports when they need to, and also have the bandwidth to be able to explore deep into that terrain,” Milnor said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe CoE is not part of HR. “We have conversations with HR all the time, but we’re actually a separate business unit,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eElpida Ormanidou, vice president of global people analytics at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the giant retailer based in Bentonville, Ark., said she moved into HR in 2008 after working in customer operations. An 11-year employee, Ormanidou was asked to build a workforce analytics team from scratch.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe department, now called people analytics, is “a pretty autonomous function,” she said. “You can lift it and put it with any discipline and it could work just like that, because all the people are technical experts in one analytical discipline or another.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWal-Mart also has a CoE that Ormanidou heads, managing a staff of around 30. The CoE provides analytics, including social media analytics, visualization and data modeling and mining services. Ormanidou also manages the point-of-sale analytics team, also around 30 people.

There’s a need for those two, but many times the question is simply, What?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn workforce planning, the what could be simply headcount, attrition rate or traditional financials. But true optimization tries to answer more difficult questions, such as which skills are undergoing a transition or that can help replace skills gaps that arise from employee movements and are usually addressed by hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOrmanidou said her take on the reporting, analytics and optimization breakdown is that business managers tend to want reports: “If you let them, they will drown in an ocean of reports and they will keep asking for more,” said.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor example, when David Scott became Wal-Mart’s head of HR, he wanted the exact count of the roughly half million out of the 2.2 million workers who leave every year.

Same with sales.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to build your skillset in college, Larson recommended you look for a school that offers interdisciplinary majors. If you’ve already graduated, she suggested registering for individual courses in data analytics or coding, or finding a design, marketing, or programming boot camp in your area like Boston’s computer programming school, General Assembly.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor those who are already employed, and want to expand their skillset within their company, Larson said workers should see if their employer would pay for them to take individual courses at a local or online college, or earn a masters degree.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“If you’re a web designer, you need to expand your universe,” Larson said. “Social media strategists are basically dinosaurs now. You’re going to be encompassed by something else like communications or marketing.

Most business leaders actually know their business really, really well. What works well for us is helping the business ask questions they may not have asked before.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eChevron’s analytics group\u0026nbsp;functions like internal consultants, Milnor said. “It’s providing the strategic questions back to the business for them to consider and providing them new options to achieve their business objectives. And that has worked extraordinarily well.” It helps to bring the HR data analytics team into the conversation at a senior level, he added.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes using HR data analytics effectively requires trial and error, Milnor said, recounting a time his group set out to analyze a learning and development program to understand its impact on Chevron, running multiple regression analyses\u0026nbsp;on the effect on attrition and productivity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“There weren’t any [effects], which kind of surprised us,” he said.

Build a team and bring in resources from finance, strategic planning or HR: It will be tougher to scale and not always efficient, but more learning is possible. Hiring a consultant is another route, but the methods will be harder to repeat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe panel consensus was that data doesn’t have to be perfectly clean, and what analysts need instead is knowledge of how much accuracy is required for each problem.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“I’ve never worked in an area where the data is perfect,” said Elpida Ormanidou, vice president of global people analytics at Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the retailer based in Bentonville, Ark. “A really good analytics person will be able to assess what is good enough. … You can make a lot better decisions from good enough data than no data at all.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKelly said never to start with data cleanup because it’s a never-ending process.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s better to decide first how much the data inconsistency influences the model and tell senior managers why it’s worth cleaning up the data.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnalytics will always involve probability-based models, according to Kelly. “You’ll never get to the point where a software vendor will be able to say, ‘Here is the future, and therefore you should plan for this.'” Instead, “futurists” can propose what-ifs\u0026nbsp;and ranges of likely outcomes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e“At the end of the day, it always goes back to the business person saying, ‘I believe this is the most likely path forward, and we’ll plan for this, and we’ll calibrate along the way.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://getedge.ai/\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGetedge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e uses advanced tools\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eto ensure the data analytics is more accurate and sensitive to business requirements.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSource:\u0026nbsp;http://searchfinancialapplications.techtarget.com/news/4500258389/HR-data-analytics-demands-sensitivity-to-business-needs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e","slug":"hr-data-analytics-demands-sensitivity-to-business-needs","subTitle":"\u003cp\u003ePanelists from Chevron, Morgan Stanley and Wal-Mart explained how to build productive relationships between HR analytics teams and the business side.

Here, employee lifetime value comes into play. It is really the long-term financial contribution of an employee, the dollar value directly attributable to an employee’s performance. Though some contributions are difficult to measure, the model would calculate lifetime value based on past performance, employee related investments, monetizing value derived. This way, organizations could use ELTV determine future investments based on past performance, time investments, maximize performance and use at as a measure of performance as well.

After all, he was a cognitive scientist.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis remarkable contribution doesn’t end with AI alone, he developed the Lisp programming language family.

Similarly, this method finds data objects in a program that cannot be accessed in the future and reclaims the resources used by those objects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe also significantly influenced the design of the ALGOL programming language which became a very influential programming language by introducing many new constructs now in common use.

He not only graduated from Belmont High School two years early but also skipped the first two years of mathematics in Caltech as he taught himself college mathematics while in his teens.

Your spreadsheets can’t do this type of work for you, but cloud-based software services are up to the task. In the end, the mix of technology and a trusted advisor/vendor can help you automate tedious workflows and save you time (and money) by helping you fine tune your plans.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo now that you have all the information, make the switch from your old spreadsheet routine to a new cloud-based software system.

While it is driven by the millennials, the need is felt by all digital citizens. We all long for ease-of-use, attractive interfaces, intuitive functionality and low prices which is provided by consumer technologies. Zoom out and you will see that it’s not just technology that is getting consumerized but lifestyle, in general – HR cannot escape being bitten by this bug! This is true of enterprise IT, employer brand, employee engagement, innovation, food, transportation, infrastructure, training, on-boarding, et al in the workplace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe touched upon BYOD influencing HR function in our earlier \u003ca style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://edgenetworks.in/2016/06/16/byod-double-edged-sword-hr/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e where we alluded to ‘Flexibility’ being a key factor in evaluating job offers for the new generation and a critical way to improve employee productivity. A culture of performance over facetime and results over time spent is the order of the day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are other areas that require to be modified to match the standards set by consumer markets. Corporate training is one such area. With the proliferation of open-online courses, there is a course or two for every subject that one could think of. There are specialized courses with customizations and are easy to access anytime, anywhere. To top it all, they are not too heavy on the pocket as well. With the business environment changing rapidly, mainly owing to advancements in technology, employees need to keep themselves up-to-date to further their professional development. Training is a key path to bridge the gap and employees demand a similar experience as they find outside of the enterprise.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTalking about training, gamification is an area that is making inroads into the HR space. Gamification enhances the interest and absorption levels of the trainee. It improves stickiness – if it has worked with angry birds and temple run, why not with corporate training. It improves the engagement levels of employees when used outside of training as well \u0026#8211; to communicate business etiquette, recruitment, safety, process, onboarding and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks to consumerization, HR professionals are having to double up as brand experts. Human resource is a key asset for most organizations where success is dependent on hiring the best of breed resources from highly competitive recruitment market. This means that HR would have to put on the marketing hat, devise the employer brand strategy, messaging and positioning to carve a niche that would attract the target audience – the employee. Brand pride is no more an area restricted to consumer marketing: Brand pride/Pride of association is as necessary in building a strong employer brand where employees act as brand ambassadors.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntrapreneurship is an offshoot as well. There has been increased focus on innovation and entrepreneurship in the recent years – VC funding is booming! Enterprises have absorbed this format to build incubators and accelerators within the organization. This encourages enterprising employees (young and old) to ideate and make it a reality while being in a secure job. The process is as professional with evaluation, selection, funding, mentorship, monetization, marketing and the works, all in place.  The enterprises gain from retaining these extraordinary bunch who otherwise would have moved out to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams and they also get to hold the IP for these path-breaking ideas – a win-win there!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn their quest to create a ‘Cool’ workspace that not only fosters innovative thinking, collaboration and engagement but also acts as a candy to the new generation, enterprises are investing heavily on building lavish office infrastructure replete with gaming corners, sleep pods, ergonomically designed desks and chairs, fitness centers, world cuisine available 24*7, huddle rooms, open spaces and what have you – Google set the trend. With the line between work and personal life blurring, employers are providing conveniences that make staff’s life seamless.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is only the beginning. CHROs are spending a vast portion of their time and money on making their workplace a competitive advantage. At the end of it all, the employee gets to have the cake and eat it too.

Predictive analytics are hugely popular in fields like genetics, economics etc. It can help HR leaders make better predictions on future hiring and recruitment needs by analysing data like current age and skill sets of employees; business growth and attrition rate.\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nPredictive Analytics plays a huge role in mitigation and having a plan B ready in case of an HR emergency.

Data Management can be split into three stages:\u003cbr /\u003e\n1. Data design- it refers to the way data is structured and organised\u003cbr /\u003e\n2. Data storage- it refers to the different ways in which data can be stored- in hard drives, RAM storage or the cloud.\u003cbr /\u003e\n3. Data security- It refers to keeping data safe from thefts and having a back up ready in case of technical glitches.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nFor HR teams dealing with vast amounts of structured and unstructured data found in CVs and employee profiles, Data Management helps save a lot of time in extracting and analysing this data by structuring it well in advance. It also makes employee data easily accessible by storing it at a central place. Since HR teams usually work with very sensitive pieces of employee data, data management also plays the crucial role of keeping data safe.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBusiness Intelligence\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it is\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nThe simplest way to explain business intelligence would be making the effective use of data and information to make well informed, sound and viable business decisions. In includes various elements like data quality and interpretation, data mining, data analysis and reporting.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nBusiness intelligence in HR can help make the right hiring and letting go decisions which are backed by data and not pre- conceived notions. For example- A first look at the resume of a candidate may reflect instability and bad work ethics if he has changed jobs too frequently. However, in reality, it could have been external economic factors, personal family reasons or other reasons that may have influenced his/ her decision. The candidate could be a perfect fit for the current role. Here, Business Intelligence would play a major role in making an information backed decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorkforce Analytics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it is\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWorkforce Analytics allows people to find meaningful trends and patterns in employee related data. The inferences could be based on basic information on, for instance, the skill set of employees, interests and hobbies, tenure served at previous jobs, amongst others. It’s an intricate process that involves compilation, manipulation and analysis of data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat it does\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\nWorkforce Analytics help optimise Human Resource Management (HRM) by helping HR leaders develop new and efficient recruiting methods, making better HR decisions and retain the best talent in the organisation. Imagine giving Chandler, good at analytical skills and a spreadsheet ninja, a role that makes the best use of his skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet’s explain it with another example- There are a lot of times when a number of vacancies in an organisation are filled by hiring new people. Workforce Analytics can help reduce external hiring by analysing the skill sets of existing employees. The employee who is very good at crunching numbers could also be very good at making presentations. A new job role which is of interest to an existing employee will add to his enthusiasm and also benefit the organisation by reducing external hiring.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us know what you think of this article.

They happen if we are addressing a big un-addressed need of the market and a large part of the populace takes advantage of it. We in India have the benefit of making Unicorns without seeking to expand business operations outside India, due to our population. We can achieve scale without tapping global markets. The startups can stay focused and do a better job.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your take on ‘open innovation’ –  where does it and doesn’t work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e‘Open Innovation’ is the way to go for companies wanting to create new things, processes and approaches. I seriously believe in a quote once famously said by Bill Joy of Sun Microsystems that “Innovation always happens elsewhere”. That is to say that we cannot incubate innovation beyond a point and the biggest innovation is likely to come from the most unlikely places. Therefore, it is the need of every company involved in Innovation to seek idea and inputs from both inside and outside the organizations. Most of the startup acquisitions by larger companies is happening because of this phenomenon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a startup investor, what are some of the key factors that you consider while evaluating a startup?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI look at the idea and its relevance to the market place in terms of addressing a real need. Scalability of the idea and its business and of course the quality and passion of the Team bringing that idea to the table. There are other things which are important like execution, sales, management etc. for which external help/mentoring can be obtained.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow has the Indian market evolved in the last decade from skilling point of view?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSkill is a hotly debated topic in India today due to the ‘demographic dividend’ that we keep referring to quite often. We have many people with education degrees and certificates, but their suitability to a job is quite limited. Lot of skill needs to be imparted to them before they become employable. No wonder many companies run University/College style class rooms within their organisations before they absorb them in their jobs. Definitely there is awareness and progress on the skill front. The National Skill India initiative and a dedicated Ministry for this purpose is very welcome and heartening. More fundamentally we need to strengthen our grass root education system in schools and colleges and impart them real education rather than the Rote model or the exam percentage measurement.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you think NASSCOM’s Skilling India initiative help boost the employment market?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is definitely of use, but not sufficient for a country as large as ours. If we look at the spread and touch points for many initiatives, it is quite limited in scale. It is daunting. My belief is that we have to do more systemic changes in the school, college and exam models for us to bring about substantive change. There are also other skill areas which are not necessarily education oriented but vocational in nature. We need a large pool of them as well, if we want to sustain our development agenda. We need carpenters, plumbers, masons, mechanics, electricians and the list goes on. There is severe shortage on that front. Nation will not run if we have only software engineers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe proliferation of digital technologies is changing the business landscape. How do you see this impacting an organizations skills mix? How should leaders gear up to ride this wave?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDigital transformation is happening all around us and is unstoppable. Everyone needs to learn to deal with everything being Digital! The newer generation is quite comfortable with the Digital scene but the earlier generations in an organisation are finding it difficult to adapt. But I am happy, the way India, particularly the rural populace has embraced Digital technologies, thanks largely to the Mobile phenomena. For leaders they have to deal with a different eco-system today. Meetings are virtual, attendance to office is optional, work from home is a large part of the design, 24\u0026#215;7 work ethic is a reality, constant connectivity and round-the-clock operations put pressure on personal time and such issues. Best is to learn to adapt than resist the change. From a personal experience, I can vouch that it is going to be fun and more productive being Digital.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are some of the hiring related challenges that you have faced and how did you overcome them?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHiring is a constant challenge. We as leaders are invested with our emotions in hiring and from an employee standpoint, it is about the balance between emotion and opportunity. Best people are attracted to companies with great people, great culture and with an opportunity to do something substantial which can add value to their career. People usually do not change or join jobs for compensation, while it is definitely a hygiene issue. It is difficult, but important to treat employees as you would treat yourself or expect to be treated by others. Long term relationships with employees brings stability, commitment, growth and a highly productive environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout Anil Valluri\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4671 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=177%2C210\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Anil Valluri\" width=\"177\" height=\"210\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=253%2C300\u0026amp;ssl=1 253w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=768%2C911\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Anil-Valluri.jpg?resize=863%2C1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 863w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 177px) 100vw, 177px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnil Valluri\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e is the President of India \u0026amp; SAARC Operations for NetApp. He joined NetApp in February 2012.

With advances in HR Technology, organisations are employing new techniques to get the best talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganisations’ growing interest in gamification can be explained by the findings from a \u003ca href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/181289/majority-employees-not-engaged-despite-gains-2014.aspx\"\u003eresearch\u003c/a\u003e by Gallup. According to the study, while millennials will constitute up to 75% of the workforce by 2025, they are the least engaged employees at work. Only 28.9% millennials feel engaged at work as compared to 32.9% Gen X and boomers. This is exactly where gamification can come to HR’s rescue. Using gamification can not only help increase engagement levels amongst employees, but also help attract the best talent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent report by Elon University stated that 53 percent Internet experts predict there will be significant advances in the usage and adoption of gamification in the workplace by 2020. Infact, the HR departments of Fortune 500 companies are already launching gamification pilots.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne would wonder how something as puerile as video games could mean serious business.  Gamification taps into the innate competitiveness of candidates and employees to help them perform better. The thrill of unlocking a new stage, collecting more badges and setting new records motivates employees to go the extra mile and work harder to gain more and more rewards.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first organisations to experiment with gamification in HR was the U.S Army. It’s highly successful game, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFc36ysBZ0A\"\u003eAmerica’s Army\u003c/a\u003e, helped the young generation of USA develop a keen interest to join the armed forces. The result? Army recruitments shot up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFollowing the success of the video game, the US army also created an army experience centre in Philadelphia where potential recruits could get a hands on experience of different army roles, bases and duties using computers and the Xbox 360. Now that’s what we call walking the talk! We couldn’t have asked for a better job description.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that gamification was the new buzzword in HR town, some of the largest brands soon followed suit. Here’s how L’Oréal, Danone and Marriot carried out some of the best HR drives using gamification.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReveal by L’Oréal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWant to work for L’Oréal? Why don’t you show them how good you are?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYup! That’s exactly what L’Oréal asked it’s potential recruits to do. The global beauty brand invited applications by asking candidates to play a virtual game.  The players played the role of a management trainee for the launch of a new L’Oréal product. To progress, the players had to solve puzzles and search clues. The game allowed the players to learn more about the brand and also about their professional skills.

They have a targeted and well-communicated talent strategy to best align their workforce with forthcoming organizational plans. Hence, HR operating model for these companies is designed to reinforce that strategy. However, what differentiates an agile organization design with that of a reactive one is in their intent and ability to adopt technology to enable this.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have often seen clients grappling with the challenge of understanding tactical and strategic workforce framework definitions. It is extremely critical to understand workforce planning entails before embracing technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere’s a simple explanation. Workforce planning, at tactical level, is about rostering, daily task scheduling and monitoring, shift planning based on forecasted volumes or client billing, and utilization. A significant portion of this rests with command center and delivery functions within an organization with off-the-shelf systems providing best-in-class monitoring technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWorkforce planning has evolved to include budgeting and forecasting where again project management offices in most companies play a critical role defining resource requirements and ensuring increased utilization and billing.  While organizations with sustained business lines need minor changes to workforce plans due to well-established operating models, new growth businesses seek the ability to scale up and down on workforce requirements based on market conditions. Realizing the potential of data integration, many companies have designed a technology backbone that enables resource requisitions based on CRM data. However, owing to lack of accurate, robust data this model fails to generate the seamlessness that is required. Approval workflows and real time data are critical in achieving the desired transactional success metrics. This would certainly result in the desired business outcome \u0026#8211; a robust plan on headcount, revenue per FTE, talent cost as percentage of overall project / organization costs and profitability.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the above plan is perfect, often times, organizations fail at executing it right as execution is a cascading phenomenon across organization hierarchy. The span of control and layers of company design plays critical role in determining success or failure of a well-defined charter. And that brings us to the next level of talent supply chain that adds a strategic spin to design consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRM’s and effectiveness COE within HR are often challenged by business to build a design and operating model that befits the budget. Understanding business requirements and linking talent management (skills, attrition forecasting, critical resources \u0026amp; roles, underdogs vs. underperformers) becomes the defining factor in this marriage. Historically, HR resorted to excel sheets to map resource skills and criticality, which was based on inputs from Project managers. They would then aggregate and normalize these. This analysis helped them make a strategic contribution to the most important asset of the business – workforce. What could really enhance their contribution is Technology. Tools that enable HR to view current vs. budget headcount, integrated sales pipeline views and integrated talent supply chain scorecards presenting a skills layer, performance layer and role fitment recommendation, will largely be essential to allow RM’s to play a truly strategic role in Workforce Management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGlobal economy is no more at the cusp of change but it’s safe to say that change is constant. Forces of startups and new age technology drive changes faster than anticipated. Companies are moving away from yearly to six monthly and quarterly guidance clearly showing impact of macro factors on business stability. The critical role of analytics and predictive insights to chart strategies and execute them flawlessly is undoubted.  Analytics is no more a separate function but an integral element to a unified workforce planning charter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo cope with this fast paced business environment, workforce planning and talent management need to work hand-in-hand. Companies that ‘smart engage and fast engage’ their workforce based on skills and competency will enjoy significant bottom-line advantage as against companies that are reactive in their approach to workforce planning. This also necessitates a change in discipline of sales managers to comply with pipeline updates. And therefore further presses the need to redesign sales incentive plans: moving from revenue coverage and buffered margin to incorporating actual achieved profitability over contract values as part of the compensation structure. Bringing about this change in the workforce planning approach will equip companies to meet and exceed guidance values. While automation is one lever, the second important lever is people allocation effectiveness.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo conclude: A powerful technology platform that enables delivery of an integrated workforce and talent roadmap is imperative to business success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-4822 alignleft\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?resize=170%2C171\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"1\" width=\"170\" height=\"171\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?w=204\u0026amp;ssl=1 204w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/1.png?resize=150%2C150\u0026amp;ssl=1 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 170px) 100vw, 170px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eAuthor – Dilshad Kothawala\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDilshad is the head of Product Strategy at EdGE Networks, an HR Tech startup, which aims to solve workforce related challenges in organizations using Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

This change has created demand for a whole new set of skills that didn’t exist a few years ago. Termed as niche skills in the IT world, SMAC and AI skills are gaining ground making other technologies obsolete. The demand for these skills is increasing in leaps and bounds and organizations are grappling with the challenge of meeting this demand. The demand and supply gap is continuing to increase although organizations are trying hard to beat competition in the recruitment market for resources with niche skills. This acute shortage has resulted in multitude of problems.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis acute shortage of niche skills results in unfulfilled demands that are long overdue which finally end up getting cancelled. Owing to this, revenues get impacted in the short term. If this becomes a persistent problem, it could impact the firm’s ability to win new business resulting in slow overall business growth.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs these niche skills are exclusive, talent economics comes into play leading to high cost of hiring this category of talent. Besides being expensive (in terms of compensation), organizations would also need to invest in making themselves attractive for such talent to choose them over others in the recruitment market.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the organization is facing a shortage of niche skills, there’s a cascading effect on multiple HR factors: upskilling existing talent and keeping them engaged, allocation via the hiring manager will be a distant dream, correcting the skills mix in the talent pyramid and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this may seem like a dooms day scenario, organizations can cater to this demand and create a buffer too – all that is needed is to look inside.

The icing on the cake is that it is a cost effective solution.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganizations could identify resources with related skills, train them on niche skills, provide job opportunities so these resources get practical experience in using these skills, upskill to keep up with the advancements in technology.  These resources could be further utilized to train another set of resources thereby ensuring a positive supply of resources with niche skills. By keeping track of the technological advancements and trends in skills, organizations could ensure they have a ready resource pool to cater to any sudden spike in demand for niche skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy leveraging trained internal talent pool, organizations not only reduce time and cost of hire but also benefit from deploying resources that reach 100% productivity quickly and fit culturally.

What makes an organization spearhead is the strength in its core of how decisions are made, executed, engagement with its staff, transparency, openness etc.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, what does it take to become a good open organization? Good Management. It can make or break both financial and cultural success. An open organization culture, where there is no complete control over the ecosystem, can sometimes prove a little challenging for people coming in from proprietary companies because the whole model, processes, team management etc. are completely different. We at Red Hat, come across such situations quite often and our way to tackle this is by balancing the cultural equilibrium and competitive advantage with our extensive on-boarding that helps with self-regulation. For eg. The Red Hat Ambassador program – The premise is that no one can find a potential or future Redhatter better than a Redhatter himself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

What does it take to build great teams, mentor and guide them through their career paths?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor an open organization or any enterprise to be successful and have a real-time alignment with their company’s vision, what the business needs is a strong team. This also means to hire new, fresh talent who can predict the roadmap and at the same time, look at their current employee fleet who may have unrecognized talent. Next-generation workers are keen to work at organizations with flattened hierarchical structures that provide greater exposure to senior leadership and encourage thinking ‘outside the box’. Next generation ways of ideation and working is epitomized by environments where the younger worker is both the mentee and the mentor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere at Red Hat, we follow a strategized development process where there are teams and individuals who will be assigned for guidance, mentorship and find the hidden talent one has. This allows transparent collaboration through every stage by making the process conversational and open to anyone and everyone who is interested. For eg: if a developer is passionate about contributing to open source cloud projects, we make sure that he/she is put into at least one challenging project thus enabling their passion to shine in their careers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3.

The technology is gaining its popularity as companies realize the benefits of the flexible service and application delivery platform. Containers simplify he life for developers and operational staff. Container based architecture does not follow the typical traditional huge architecture and need not manage, pack, upgrade, migrate, replicate all the time. It makes life simpler to manage immutable deployments of microservices-based architectures. The awareness of the technology and benefits thereon has been steadily growing, and continuous efforts in enhancing its usability and capabilities are very much in progress. However, this might take a little while still for enterprises to fully accept and implement it in their systems and processes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5.

Security being one of the main concerns, one must look at requirements and decide whether containers are a good fit or no\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMost enterprises have not moved a significant number of workloads to the cloud, much less to containers running on clouds. As enterprises move to containers, one needs to make a significant investment in training and hiring to obtain the skillsets that would be needed to build and deploy containerized applications\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnterprises have created and begun implementation of a cloud computing strategy, they now need to consider containers as a sub-strategy. Containers will have other uses with IoT applications, big data, and even traditional, on-premises systems that will stay on premises. Thus, containers are not just for clouds, but they are mostly for the r cloud\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnterprises are all moving to containers and one should always test any new technology’s scalability, stability, data, management and governance and security The use of containers is growing within enterprises, and the vendors in this space want to learn more about this technology as adoption spreads rapidly.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e6.

With the advent of open container initiative, what changes do you foresee in the landscape?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Open Container Initiative (OCI) is a collaborative project hosted under the Linux Foundation designed to establish common standards for containers. Specifically, the OCI says containers should not be bound to a specific client or orchestration stack, not be tightly associated with any vendor and should be portable across a wide variety of operating systems, hardware and architectures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThough the OCI technology has been around for a little more than a year and has achieved good success, there are still quite a few elements to work on in terms of handling changes and new demands, supporting backward and forward compatibility of the future etc. The mission of the OCI is to promote and promulgate a set of common, minimal, open standards and specifications around container technology. Hence the roadmap with this technology isto ensure standards for containers and future container platforms that preserve the flexibility and open nature of containers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\" wp-image-5176 alignleft\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?resize=196%2C252\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"rajesh\" width=\"196\" height=\"252\" srcset=\"https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?resize=233%2C300\u0026amp;ssl=1 233w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rajesh.jpg?w=413\u0026amp;ssl=1 413w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003eRajesh Rege, Managing Director, Red Hat India\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRajesh Rege, Managing Director, Red Hat, heads the India Operations of the world\u0026#8217;s leading provider of open source solutions.

But examined critically, those become outcomes; they have to be worked toward and earned.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, HR can earn a strategic role, but it means thinking in an entirely different way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe C-suite is eagerly looking at HR to prove its mettle and stake its claim at the executive table. After all, a company is only as good as its workforce, and HR is largely responsible with building that winning team.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eHR, more enabler than strategic influencer\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking at HR’s trajectory over the years, it’s easy to see how its importance has diminished steadily. In other words, its viewed more as an enabler – focused on operational tasks – and not a strategic partner.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile other functions have been demanding technology and automation to up their ante – HR is lagging far behind. 2015 saw $2.4 billion in VC funding for HR tech and new HR tech startups, but many companies still aren’t investing in this technology. But if HR departments shift their focus to become big-goal advisors, who contribute to a company’s strategy and direction, they can not only campaign for better technology platforms, but also earn that coveted seat at the table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eConsidering people data\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHR tech and analytics need to be focused on strategy, data, and analysis, with the KPIs focused of advancing the value of the company. Yet, let’s not forget that HR is all about people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese analytics could measure employees in terms of the value they add to the overall company strategy. HR needs to adopt a long term view of the situation and realize that instead of concentrating on hire rate, they should make sure they’re recruiting the right people who directly contribute to the company’s main goal and help them progress on the roadmap to success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, instead of endlessly debating employee retention percentages, the HR team should evaluate whether they’re keeping the people who truly matter to the company goals, and reorganizing the unnecessary roles or the underperforming employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eDefining goals \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWell, it isn’t HR’s responsibility alone to figure out what a company’s strategic objectives should be.

The company cannot provide the best experience to its customers without the right, qualified people in those key positions, with the right measurements to analyze and course correct if needed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThinking like a C-suite executive\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn other words, HR needs to think strategically. In most organizations, HR is an overhead department, a cost centre. A business cannot get away with providing products and services that do not add value to the customer for very long. Eventually, they lose the business. It\u0026#8217;s hard to fire an overhead department, but the business can influence cost reductions beyond what is reasonable if leaders don\u0026#8217;t see value in the work being done.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHR has to shift this paradigm and think like a business owner concerned with budgets and customer satisfaction. HR should define its customers (employees, leaders, customers and other stakeholders), identify their needs, provide products and services that meet those needs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eForward-thinking measures\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHR has often been wrongfully accused of not being future-focused.

Naturally then, organizations would be concerned and want to know what their people are doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July this year, newspaper reports suggested that the Indian government planned to prevent its employees from posting social media posts critical of any government policy or action. The government is not alone, many private corporations also prescribe rules and guidelines for social media conduct for their employees. The fear of reputation damage is so high that some of them have become extremely vigilant of what their workforce is doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t even have to be existing employee for your social media usage to be tracked; an organization you have applied to for a job may also want to know more about you through your online behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow are a few critical areas that an existing or would-be employer could be tracking on your social media:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSocial networking profiles:\u003c/strong\u003e Organizations with social media policies and guidelines will want to keep an eye on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles of their employees to see if the set rules are not being violated. Other organizations may simply do this to understand your work-life balance and to see if you are facing any work related issues that may find a vent online. In many cases, your colleagues are friends on your social profiles and they may flag any concern to the HR department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReligious, racial or political inclinations:\u003c/strong\u003e Many individuals carry strong religious or political inclinations and do not hesitate to share extreme viewpoints.

In fact, some advanced HR tools now offer social search; allowing prospective employers to discover ideal candidates through social media profiles.

It could be about entrusting them with execution of an important project, offering timely feedback, rewards and recognitions, creatively incentivizing them, providing a mentor to nurture their skills and talents, or promoting them out-of-turn on merit and performance. Any or all of these approaches will enhance their professional experience and build loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillennials are an impetuous generation, with an inbuilt sense of entitlement and seeking quick gratification.

Then, organizations would be concerned and need to realize what their folks are doing on the web.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn July last year, newspaper reports suggested that the Indian government planned to prevent its employees from posting social media posts critical of any government policy or action. The government is not alone, many private corporations also prescribe rules and guidelines for social media conduct for their employees. The fear of reputation damage is so high that some of them have become extremely vigilant of what their workforce is doing online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou don’t even have to be existing employee for your social media usage to be tracked; an organization you have applied to for a job may also want to know more about you through your online behavior.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe following are a couple of basic territories that a current or would-be manager could track on your online networking:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial networking profiles: Organizations with social media policies and guidelines will want to keep an eye on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles of their employees to see if the set rules are not being violated. Other organizations may simply do this to understand your work-life balance and to see if you are facing any work related issues that may find a vent online. In many cases, your colleagues are friends on your social profiles and they may flag any concern to the HR department.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReligious, racial or political inclinations: Many individuals carry strong religious or political inclinations and do not hesitate to share extreme viewpoints. Such behavior could even cost them their jobs, as US Mayor Beverly Whaling recently learnt to her chagrin, after her unpleasant comment on the US First Lady Michelle Obama.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSoft skills: Particularly relevant for prospective hires; hiring managers at would-be employers would want to observe how you express yourself, and how you deal with people online. Your online posts and comments could be grounds to make inferences as to whether you have the necessary soft skills, including networking and people management.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetworking skills: A prospective employee’s online connections can be a powerful window for organizations to understand how well networked he or she could be. Most companies view a well-connected employee as an asset as there are chances that the employee could create and convert business opportunities from her online connections.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContributions to communities: Whether you are a programmer or a marketing or HR executive, your contribution to relevant online communities like StackExchange, Quora or CiteHR could also be tracked by existing as well as prospective employer to better gauge your skills, knowledge, and your ability to contribute as a team member.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePer a recent media report, social media plays a crucial role in the hiring process today with over 94 percent recruiters using LinkedIn to recruit new candidates, while 79 percent of job seekers use social media to find new jobs. In fact, some advanced HR tools now offer social search; allowing prospective employers to discover ideal candidates through social media profiles.

It continues executing the other parts of the program and whenever the “fs” finished reading the myFile.txt, the callback will be called to process necessary statements.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFast processing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003enodeJS uses V8 JavaScript Runtime engine, the one that Google Chrome uses. nodeJS has a wrapper over this JavaScript engine providing some extra facilities to build network applications.

The million-dollar question accordingly at the forefront of everybody\u0026#8217;s mind is: the thing that drives these millennials – what makes them tick?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, here’s a look at how organizations can crack the code and keep the millennials in their workplace engaged and driven at work, and win their loyalties.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide freedom with responsibility: Millennials love their freedom as much as they love their smart devices. During work hours, this smartphone or tablet addiction may even hamper their productivity. To get them to focus on their work, our advice is to not restrict them – but to be liberal with your trust and creative freedom – and clear about deadlines and responsibilities.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBe creative in assigning responsibilities: Millennials love responsibility where they can show their leadership abilities. It’s a good thing to remember that they also love creative freedom and prize flexibility in their work schedules. So, make them take over office parties, the daily ‘coffee-quiz’ and the fun Fridays.   in addition to their work responsibilities. Not only will this excite them but they will also love the attention and importance they get.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAppreciate and encourage them: Millennials crave recognition; and managers should devote special attention to provide genuine feedback and appreciation. It works better when it is constructive. HR business partners can ask line managers to draft handwritten notes to thank their young colleagues for a job well done.  Sending recognition mails marking senior members of the team if they met a deadline for a crucial project could also go a long way in motivating millennials.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStand up for work-life balance and flexibility: Most millennials are acutely conscious of having a life outside office and do not like to mess up with their work-life balance. For them performing well and being a high-achiever at work is as important as spending time with friends, often pursuing a hobby or simply partying. They are blurring the divide between professional and personal life without compromising on either. Organizations can be mindful of the change this generation is bringing along at the workplace and create flexible work time policies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProvide a rich professional experience to them: Millennials can be impulsive when it comes to job-hopping, but they also love to stay in a role that adds value and learning to their CVs. If you wish to retain them, consider providing a rich professional experience to them. It could be about entrusting them with execution of an important project, offering timely feedback, rewards and recognitions, creatively incentivizing them, providing a mentor to nurture their skills and talents, or promoting them out-of-turn on merit and performance. Any or these approaches will enhance their professional experience and build loyalty.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMillennials are an impetuous generation, with an inbuilt sense of entitlement and seeking quick gratification. However, they are also out of the box thinkers, very creative and talented; and can be extremely passionate about whatever they take up in life, and that includes a job in your organization. They live for themselves and want to make a difference.

This activity demands to understand a JD and a resume at a higher, deeper level. This requires a lot of messy wanderings through unstructured text, extracting important skills and traits from each section, and coming up with a similarity score between a resume and JD. It could sometimes become very difficult as it is hard to teach a machine how to extract important information from unstructured text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eReady for a fun fact?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf all the animals that evolved in our planet, somehow, we are the only species able to create a syntactic and semantic complex-rule based language for our communication!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe rich set of vocabulary, contextual information and syntax makes it tough for a machine to parse important information. Yet, we are getting very good at understanding JDs and resumes using a set of new tools in our arsenal, which includes Deep Learning.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Deep Learning?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning, based on modern neural networks has been able to surpass human level inaccuracies in various domains. It is fascinating to us because it can efficiently encode a lot of contextual information, which helps us to understand the important features automatically. Previous machine learning models required us to do a lot of manual feature engineering but with Deep Learning that has changed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDeep Learning can automatically infer most of the features, and even beat those shallow learning approaches in many cases if tuned properly with enough data. For example: a trained sequential model could differentiate between \u0026#8216;working with project manager\u0026#8217; and \u0026#8216;working as project manager\u0026#8217;. A one-hot encoded vector could be easily fooled in thinking that both of the sentences are almost similar, but a Deep Learning based recurrent neural network can use the contextual information in making a decision.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePredicting the relevant title\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNatural language has a lot of variations like the one we have mentioned in the earlier example. Although a naive algorithm would be able to extract important skills from a job description and a resume, it could make a lot of silly mistakes. What if we can reduce a job description and a resume to a birds-eye-view and look at it in a different perspective altogether?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also work directly with client specific problems, one of such important problems is to hire good external candidates from job portals like Naukri, Monster and Shine. Sometimes, it becomes tough to identify the candidate title as they can be very specific to a client. For example, client could internally call a role as \u0026#8216;Desktop Engineer Band 2\u0026#8217;, but the actual role is for a \u0026#8216;Desktop Support Engineer\u0026#8217;. When searching for candidates externally, it would be better to use titles like desktop engineer or desktop support engineer. Using alternative titles in querying for candidates would improve the relevancy of the search results. Here is one such job description. If we can predict these alternative titles, it could be used as a way to normalize titles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6104\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?resize=686%2C359\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"686\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1.png?w=1145\u0026amp;ssl=1 1145w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6106\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?resize=694%2C416\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/2.png?w=911\u0026amp;ssl=1 911w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 694px) 100vw, 694px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe model\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere has been criticism about Deep Learning and it\u0026#8217;s black box nature. It looks like magic, but at its core it really boils down to using dense vector representations and a lot of super-cool mathematics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhy do you need a Deep Learning model when you can train multiple linear classifiers and interpret what features are effecting your result directly?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can give several reasons as to why shallow learning methods are inefficient. But as a good debater once told me, when you don\u0026#8217;t have one solid good reason, you need to have several reasons!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, linear or logistic regression considers each class independently and trains multiple classifiers. This is not true in the real world. Each class might interact and be correlated with the other. A Deep Learning model uses shared parameters among all the classes, this generalizes better to unseen data than individual classifiers. Also, there has been research suggesting that deep learning can be very \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10694\"\u003eresistant to noise in labels\u003c/a\u003e. And, Deep Learning models can scale well with data. As deep learning uses matrix multiplications, it can be efficiently implemented on a GPU. Moreover, they are not black boxes. You can interpret them as you would interpret a linear regression model, but it\u0026#8217;s just a little more difficult. Again, the current research in \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf\"\u003eattention models\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07182\"\u003ecombination of reinforcement and supervised learning\u003c/a\u003e are guiding us towards a more interpretable deep learning models.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo achieve the task of extracting relevant titles, we have trained a deep recurrent neural network on almost 5 million parsed resumes, JDs and title pairs. The dataset contains the data from various domains. In the data preparation stage, classes with very low number of occurrences were removed. The samples were tokenized into sentences and then sentences were tokenized into words. Each word is assigned an index with a random embedding that is learned during the training phase. The pre-processing was kept to a minimum except for word lowercasing. We have not identified any phrases beforehand. The model hyperparameters: word embedding size of 300, a word level Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with hidden state of size 200, a sentence level GRU with hidden state of size 200 and around 2600 classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt uses a uses a hierarchical structure that encodes the given unstructured text into a vector using a recurrent neural network inspired by this \u003ca href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~diyiy/docs/naacl16.pdf\"\u003eresearch work\u003c/a\u003e. Each sentence is passed through a network called Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which tries to capture the important information in the sentence. These sentences (with their vectors) are clubbed together to form a sentence vector by using another GRU. By using this structure, we can reduce all the complexity in the unstructured text to a single vector which could be used to make a prediction about the title it belongs to.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll the weights are initialized randomly, and the whole network is optimized with negative log likelihood objective function with a softmax at the end to normalize the probabilities. The model was trained with SGD optimizer, the learning rate was chosen by closely monitoring validation loss on a small dataset. Gradient clipping was also used. The validation loss was monitored at the end of each epoch, and early stopping was used as a regularization technique to avoid overfitting. At the end of seventh epoch, the validation loss started increasing, so training was halted. The model reached around 24.5 top-1 accuracy before it stopped improving.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere is the training loss of the model plotted against minibatch number.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6109\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?resize=693%2C469\u0026#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" width=\"693\" height=\"469\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=300\u0026amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=768\u0026amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=1024\u0026amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/3.png?w=1030\u0026amp;ssl=1 1030w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 693px) 100vw, 693px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis was the first of the 2 part blog series on how Deep Learning can effectively help us decode JDs.

Making machines perform tasks more effortlessly and efficiently has been around for decades. What is happening now is nothing but pushing the boundaries of AI far ahead, to enhance customer service and personalization, identify patterns and trends, and answer banking queries real-time and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet us go through a few broad implications on how AI is transforming the BFSI sector \u0026#8211;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking banking efficient and effective\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI coupled with automation has transformed banking services by leaps and bounds. Automation has made day-to-day banking more efficient and simpler. We don’t need a teller anymore to help us deposit money or cheques at a bank; we can sit in the comfort of our homes and apply for loans, buy insurance, transfer money online and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe are already interacting with chatbots, digital assistants and getting our day-to-day banking done online and finances related queries sorted efficiently. With the new dimensions of AI being infused in the BFSI sector, we will soon see it achieve a greater level of capabilities while simultaneously making banking processes less time consuming and simpler.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a Digital Banking Report, \u003ca href=\"https://thefinancialbrand.com/58063/personalization-in-banking-digital-research-study/\"\u003eThe Power of Personalization in Banking\u003c/a\u003e, it was found that consumers want to share their personal information if they can receive custom advice, offers and service based on this shared insight. Personalized communications and advice as enabled by AI can be reflected by online advisors – that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the help of a human counterpart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAI that enhances the customer experience significantly will be the primary use case for financial organizations to up their use of technology in the future.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePutting human talent to better use\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the primary reasons why financial institutions are adopting AI in a big way is because it is helping them improve customer experiences. AI can take seemingly routine and repetitive processes and make them efficient and effective, without human effort.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: what used to be a very tedious process of new customer onboarding, communication can now become highly personalized interactions, based on individual activity after opening an account. This level of personalization was almost impossible to achieve in the past without the benefits of machine learning and AI.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile machine learning is making banking systems more intelligent  \u0026#8211; identifying patterns and connections that humans can\u0026#8217;t \u0026#8211; most machines will not replace a bank’s staff or personnel. Human interactions will be required for consumers who have more complex queries and requirements. In fact, bank employees view chatbots as a great help that allow employees to focus on closing more complex tasks and conversations, while bots perform the generic tasks faster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, the key for financial institutions would be to use technology and human talent in a calculated way. While AI can complete compliance requirements, customer informational documentation, routine tasks and even product ‘frequently asked question’ responses – bank employees will have more time for strategic tasks that require empathy and intelligence.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe rise of new-age Fin-tech players\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFin-tech, of late is riding a huge growth wave using AI.

Many players in the space have seized the opportunity and are growing at an exponential rate. The reason these players have witnessed tremendous success is because via their offerings, they are making an effort to simplify financial processes for consumers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example: mobile wallets have become hugely popular as they have made day-to-day transactions much easier for people.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA recent \u003ca href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/indian-m-wallet-market-expected-to-be-rs-1512-bn-by-fy22-4448353/\"\u003eASSOCHAM report\u003c/a\u003e says that the mobile-wallet market in India is expected to grow at over 190% to reach Rs 1,512 billion by financial year 2022 from the current level of about Rs.1.5 billion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis clearly outlines the fact that people are willing to adopt new technologies that makes their finance related procedures hassle free.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe banking and financial services sector in India needs to embrace technological advancements like AI to plan for a rapidly changing future.

It is often noticed by corporates that a team of talented individuals always bring more laurels to the company inform of significant achievements like crucial project wins, customer satisfaction and more.

The millennial workforce is also known to take pride in donning several hats. If experimenting with different roles at work brings job satisfaction to them, encourage and enable it. Your data scientist may be a graphic designing expert too and could even take over the role of social media expert in the need of the hour.

At the ground level, keeping fun a priority in office could be challenging. However, one could keep a check on how much time and effort that’s going into fun and creativity should receive during work hours by checking on the overall employee morale. If you are noticing that the general work environment is grumpy, dull and low, frequent breaks for fun and creative activities could immediately boost up the workplace energy.

Offering flexibility to suit employees’ need will also work out as a great people retention strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHealth and wellness are also areas of interest to employees now and organizations would do well to provide free fitness and meditation classes, healthy food options, intramural sports and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEncourage entrepreneurial talent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWho would you include in the team to lead your next big project \u0026#8211; an employee who is self-motivated and enthusiastic or the one who works great at following orders and instructions?

While some thought leaders are of the view that AI will disrupt the workforce with robots, VR, bots and more \u0026#8211; others even suggest that organisations will eventually do away with HR as a function and let domain leaders get involved in people management processes to make it more inclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe let the thought leaders visualize the future while we take a dive into what’s helping HR and taking it to the next level in the present. As we observe the world around us, it’s easy to see that machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) have already begun to change the way we understand how our organizations work, how functions are getting automated and smarter, helping us make the most effective decisions in our roles as human experts.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest advantage of ML is that it reacts faster than humans in identifying insights and inferences that might otherwise take plenty of manpower and time or not be identified at all.

Further, with more innovation, the possibilities seem endless, especially in combinations of individual factors and patterns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe people engagement puzzle\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudies suggest that fifty percent of candidates don’t receive any type of communication or have any type of interaction with an employer once they apply for a role or come on board. With the help of algorithms, candidate engagement can be automated and made unique not just during employee onboarding but post that also. The interactive algorithms can help the new employee with relevant information regarding team, domain expertise and more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the area of employee engagement will always have a large human, tactile component – ML can help identify trends by understanding what it is that keeps employees happy at their organization.

AI algorithms could evaluate performance data without any personal bias for the candidate.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, organisations can also use AI to map employees’ career paths and gear them up for career progression. Employees may need support with customized training and learning information that supervisor may not always provide.
