From a fledgling to its current state, I have seen the evolution of an idea to execution, with moments of extinction in between. Starting a company in India, building and selling products and solutions to the Indian customer are an unparalleled experience. The most important facet of my learning is the people that build our team, the soul of the entity we call EdGE Networks, a myriad of hope, expression, want and fulfilment. It is this passion and soulful energy that I wake to every morning of the week and begin a beautiful, bright day. Thank you people, thank you friends and family, thank you all for having the guts to walk through the door and be a part of a new beginning.”</p><p>Priyadarshi Lahiri, Head- Technology, says, “I have been at EdGE now for 3 years. And it is in this time that I have truly understood who I really am as a person and what my true calling is. It has been an extremely exciting journey building a platform that has the potential to define Recruitment and Workforce Optimization 2.0 from how enterprises see it today. Building trust with our customers, building a great application, the data science team innovating to create better offerings, and serving our customers better is what has kept me and my team busy and we have loved every moment of it.”</p><p>Great going, EdGE Networks!
