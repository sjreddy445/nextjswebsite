This interview is a part of our 'The New Talent Paradigm' series. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Welcome to the EDGE Show, Shruthi. Thank you so much for joining us today.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> Thank you so much. Quite excited to be on your show.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> Thank you. So, we'll jump onto the questions now. So, Shruthi, there's been a lot of discussion on diversity and inclusivity over the past few years. However, many are still confused about what they are and how they work. So, you know, for us, for the benefit of others, could you please elucidate what it means and what all does it include?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> See, I look at it in a very simple way. So when you think about all of that, that's I think, and being inclusive around all those types of people, you know, who they are, how they are, you included. How you can work around that I think that's really about the whole inclusion piece and what happened so, but there are many aspects of diversity, and I think that's important for people to, you know, understand. We've always known about gender and racial diversity, but today, there's generational, there's geographical. There's cognitive diversity. So, there's a whole bunch of it. But to answer your question on one more aspect, I think today it's not only about diversity and inclusion, but equity as well. I believe that is what we all need to understand - where we work, you know, it could even be at home, and you know, we're all in the social space as well, so I think it's that part about equity as well. So that's how I would look at it under now.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So, you know, this has been there. Itâ€™s not something new. People from varied races cultures come together to work together. That has always been there. So, why suddenly talk about it or the need for it as an organizational objective. Because you see, the conversation has really, really grown over the past couple of years. So, what led to this shift?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi: </strong>That's a very interesting question. We all have observed around us that this shift is happeningâ€¦not just at an organizational level but in our social arena as well. There is more focus on women, on race etc. Once again, I'm going to go back to the equity bit of it. I can talk about the shift on the organization side, of course. See, there are many talks, and I think that's what we have to understand â€” is it all just talk, or some real difference is being made? But to answer your first question, there is a rise in talent, search of talent or the talent war. And in all these different things people are talking about, the technology impact that's coming about is enormous. Where everybody has access to so much more information, education being available, and opportunities being available, at least we can think about it more equitably. And yet there is a pay gap, fewer women on the board etc. And if they are on the board, are they really making decisions? So, several things come into play here. And then look at the social aspect of so many people from smaller towns, and I'm going to stick to India, but if you look at it globally as well, people coming into the cities, so mindsets are changing. There's a shift happening, and that is what we see over a period of time. You know, when you say, why all this talk in organizations; the talk has been there, the talk has happened, and diversity and inclusion days have happened, I think, today, what we really need to talk about is, has that shift occurred, has that needle moved? Or is it just companies being pressured to deliver on diversity goals? Or are there companies that are genuinely trying to make that change? So, I mean, we'll talk more about it, and I'm sure you will have more questions around it, but I think that's what we need to ask ourselves.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya: </strong>How do multi-generational workforce and technology form a part of it? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> It is the part of the answer that I was giving you. You know, this whole demographic shift that's happening, where people are moving to get jobs. When I say multiple, you say, multi-generational, I think it's also about in one workplace today, you have people from GenX to GenY, to today's millennials, and of course, the Gen Z are young, but it's not far away when they will also be a part of the workforce. But what does it mean from a diversity and inclusion perspective? I was reading this article, where it was talking about, there are hardly any directors on the board who are less than 50 years of age. So, on the one hand, we see that an experienced person sometimes prevents the young in the organization from reinventing the wheel; at the same time, organizations are also faced with this decision-making of creating 'Products &amp; Solutions' almost an everyday basis. So, here is what we need to think about - they're already there in the organization. What organizations need to think about is how they will make multi-generational workforces combine and work seamlessly. I've been very fascinated about this whole thing around cognitive diversity. And I think that's really where we should all be heading to. </p><p style="text-align:justify;">But we're, of course, still solving some of the basics around diversity and inclusion, and we're still stuck at gender, race etc. Additionally, now you have the whole LGBTQ workforce coming in, so how are your systems geared up? How are your processes geared up? How is your performance management geared up to handle this? How's your hiring geared up? Do they all have access to equal opportunities? And let me tell you in the multi-generational workforce, and I love your question, because tomorrow, we're going to have robots working with us. How are you going to interact with them? You have to feel, treat them equally. You have to be inclusive around them. You have to accept even their flaws, help them get better, make peace with the fact that they can do certain things much better than us. So, it is also about all these things in a multi-generational workforce. So, I think creating a psychologically safe space for all these different types of a generational, multi-generational workforce will be the key to thinking about diversity in the long term for organizations. It's already here, and they need to be prepared.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> This brings us to a fascinating question where I would like your thoughts. The other day we were, I read an article by Rishad Premji in the India Express, where he talked about Human Development Growth (HDP). And one of the measures mentioned there was the need to increase the participation of women. Because reports say that, even though there is so much hullabaloo around this topic - around inclusivity, diverse diversity, you know, getting women into the workforce. Still, in the last few years, we've seen considerably decreased participation from the workforce. There are very, very few women in the decision-making posts right now. As I said, there's a lot of work, but what is happening at the ground level is something that I'm thinking about. What are your thoughts on this? Even for our LGBT community, people are not ready to accept the fact. We may say we are pretty modern and think out of the box, but we don't do it at a certain level.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> Yeah, no, you're right. Rishad, this right, obviously, also, because it's here for all of us to see, right. The sad thing is what you said, 'the report says that it's getting lesser when it should have been getting better, ' right? We started so many years before; that's exactly how you started this conversation. We have started so many years before. And if you see, there is so much more awareness about this whole thing. Do you agree that there's awareness? Diversity is important. You need to focus on it; all that has also happened. But it has just become about that day. About March 8. The LGBTQ Day. So, this is where I think, organizations, and I would say, this is now not about HR, this is not about the diversity officer who needs to be worried, what should I be doing? How do I increase this? </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">This is a CEOs mandate. It should be. The CEO should be rallying around this. Let me give you an example. So, if there is an issue with the sales numbers, how does a CEO approach it? The CEO won't be saying, let me create a celebrate sales month? And then because we're celebrating it, sales will improve? Of course not. That's not the way it happens. They get down to where the issue is. What are the ways to fix it? They look, think about it as a business problem. They think about it as tools and what can be done to enable salespeople and change mindsets and talk to customers. And, you know, what are the metrics saying what the evidence around the metrics is, so they approach it entirely like a business problem. And I think that is precisely how this has to be looked at. Only then and, coming straight down from the CEO, because that's when the other business leaders who are primarily male will look at doing this entire thing - making the needle move in a very different way. So, the approach to this cannot be about how we have done it, which is about celebrating it and making a day out of it and then forgetting it. It has to be about hiring an equal number of people; are we giving an equal number of opportunities? What does a performance management system expect out of managers? That's how it needs to be looked at. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So, your question on what's happening at the grassroots level - grassroots level is the same. In fact, grassroots level, if you look at any IT company, 50% of the workforce are equal when they come from the colleges, then after you see this really sharp drop, as people you know, get to the top. Now there are several reasons for that. But what a company is doing to enable that if people have to take off for different reasons. And in this particular case, if it needs to be a woman, how do the policies and processes work to ensure that they can come back faster. And once they come back, how easy it is to bring them back into the mainstream seamlessly. There are a lot of things that need to be done. But the first and foremost thing is it has to become a business item and a business agenda. Just like if your sales were high, you know, your sales numbers were low. I mean, that's almost like the most extreme example I'm taking, but it needs to be looked at like that if we want to see a shift.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya:</strong> So again, I'll be coming back to the question that one, why is it important at the workplace? And how can organizations move from 'some' to a 'from all' concept steadily?</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> So Anannya, I think I've answered some of it in my answer about how can organizations move to it? I think the answer lies, and I genuinely believe it is about the topmost leader because you're watching the topmost leader become a business item, and then the agenda, that's how it needs to be looked at, and it will work. In organizations, especially bias on the ground happens in different ways.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">There are five types of ways that it happens. So, I think this is what organizations probably need to look at to ensure that it does not occur. It borders on unconscious bias. But I think it's happening as we speak. So other than this, one way of doing itâ€¦the answer is, of course, the CEO making it a business agenda. The other way is to understand what all these biases are. So, for example, typically, for some people in an organization, this could be anywhere, globally, because whether it's race, gender, LGBTQ age, disability, sometimes even social class, this happens to different types of people.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">So one is â€“ <strong>'Prove it Again'</strong>. Sadly, there are many people in an organization; they just have to prove it again. So you could do something, but you will have to do it again. And again. And again. Unlike we are used to a standard person who would do it, and you'll be like, wow, that's amazing, this person met the sales target. Now think about it, if there was somebody in the example that I gave you, because of our biases was on race or gender or age, you just be like, 'oh, maybe this was one time. Let's see if they can do it again.' You know, so this prove it again, bias is sort of inherent in organizations. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">The second is <strong>'That Tight Rope'</strong>. What that means is â€” if men, again largely, show that they are authoritative, you're like, wow, what a leader, walking the tight rope. But the same thing if women were to do it? The first thing people would be like, Oh! This person is so bossy? So, that's the thing. You look at it differently. And again, it's the bias. So, these are things that organizations should train people on. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">The third one is interesting. It's called the '<strong>Tug of War'</strong>, which is a tug of war between like if I'm one woman, and up for that one position and there is a seat on the table only for a woman to come into this particular say panel or board. I'm now going to be having this tug of war with other women. And the same thing with race or people of colour, they are doing it with this similar type. </p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">The fourth one is what we all call the <strong>'Maternal Wall.'</strong> This is to do with women who actually come back and mothers who feel they need to prove that they need to do more. So, it's also about them themselves, but also the organization. They should be thinking about making it much easier because women are constantly otherwise about having to prove themselves. Organizations have to do this better for their seamless transition.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;">Now the fifth one is just <strong>'Racial Stereotypes'</strong>. Now we could be in India, but you know, to some extent, we're saying we're from the North, South, East or the Western part of the country. It just comes now; we don't even mean it so, and we sometimes bring that kind of stereotyping as well into into into work. So, there's so much we all need to work on, not only as organizations but also as individuals. That's how I would look at it. It's a combination. If we are all looking at this globalized world, we all have to drop our armour somehow.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Anannya: </strong>Absolutely right. There are instances, you know, while we were talking about this, I could reflect on. I've seen it, or I've faced it. These biases have been there; of course, they were nonintentional, but they've happened. Oh! You are a mother who's coming back after a seven-year hiatus? My God, how are you going to do it? How will you manage?<strong> </strong>And then the other way around â€” if you do it and you're succeeding at it, then they're thinking that maybe they're you're neglecting to be a great mother. This is so relatable, and it's not just me alone. There are so many women across the board who go through a day-in-day-out, and as I said, it's not intentional. It is how we've been brought up.</p><p style="text-align:justify;"> </p><p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Shruthi:</strong> Absolutely. And it's a socialist, by the way, this entire thing. What do we take to work is who we are and who are we? We are all that we are when we are not at work. How we grew up, how we are at home, so organizations they'll train you and everything but end of the day you are going back home. There is a whole social aspect to how you live today. So, it's tough; it's not easy.

So, we'll jump onto the questions now. So, Shruthi, there's been a lot of discussion on diversity and inclusivity over the past few years. However, many are still confused about what they are and how they work. So, you know, for us, for the benefit of others, could you please elucidate what it means and what all does it include?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e See, I look at it in a very simple way. So when you think about all of that, that's I think, and being inclusive around all those types of people, you know, who they are, how they are, you included. How you can work around that I think that's really about the whole inclusion piece and what happened so, but there are many aspects of diversity, and I think that's important for people to, you know, understand. We've always known about gender and racial diversity, but today, there's generational, there's geographical. There's cognitive diversity. So, there's a whole bunch of it. But to answer your question on one more aspect, I think today it's not only about diversity and inclusion, but equity as well. I believe that is what we all need to understand - where we work, you know, it could even be at home, and you know, we're all in the social space as well, so I think it's that part about equity as well. So that's how I would look at it under now.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So, you know, this has been there. Itâ€™s not something new. People from varied races cultures come together to work together. That has always been there. So, why suddenly talk about it or the need for it as an organizational objective. Because you see, the conversation has really, really grown over the past couple of years. So, what led to this shift?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eThat's a very interesting question. We all have observed around us that this shift is happeningâ€¦not just at an organizational level but in our social arena as well. There is more focus on women, on race etc. Once again, I'm going to go back to the equity bit of it. I can talk about the shift on the organization side, of course. See, there are many talks, and I think that's what we have to understand â€” is it all just talk, or some real difference is being made? But to answer your first question, there is a rise in talent, search of talent or the talent war. And in all these different things people are talking about, the technology impact that's coming about is enormous. Where everybody has access to so much more information, education being available, and opportunities being available, at least we can think about it more equitably. And yet there is a pay gap, fewer women on the board etc. And if they are on the board, are they really making decisions? So, several things come into play here. And then look at the social aspect of so many people from smaller towns, and I'm going to stick to India, but if you look at it globally as well, people coming into the cities, so mindsets are changing. There's a shift happening, and that is what we see over a period of time. You know, when you say, why all this talk in organizations; the talk has been there, the talk has happened, and diversity and inclusion days have happened, I think, today, what we really need to talk about is, has that shift occurred, has that needle moved? Or is it just companies being pressured to deliver on diversity goals? Or are there companies that are genuinely trying to make that change? So, I mean, we'll talk more about it, and I'm sure you will have more questions around it, but I think that's what we need to ask ourselves.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eHow do multi-generational workforce and technology form a part of it?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e It is the part of the answer that I was giving you. You know, this whole demographic shift that's happening, where people are moving to get jobs. When I say multiple, you say, multi-generational, I think it's also about in one workplace today, you have people from GenX to GenY, to today's millennials, and of course, the Gen Z are young, but it's not far away when they will also be a part of the workforce. But what does it mean from a diversity and inclusion perspective? I was reading this article, where it was talking about, there are hardly any directors on the board who are less than 50 years of age. So, on the one hand, we see that an experienced person sometimes prevents the young in the organization from reinventing the wheel; at the same time, organizations are also faced with this decision-making of creating 'Products \u0026amp; Solutions' almost an everyday basis. So, here is what we need to think about - they're already there in the organization. What organizations need to think about is how they will make multi-generational workforces combine and work seamlessly. I've been very fascinated about this whole thing around cognitive diversity. And I think that's really where we should all be heading to.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eBut we're, of course, still solving some of the basics around diversity and inclusion, and we're still stuck at gender, race etc. Additionally, now you have the whole LGBTQ workforce coming in, so how are your systems geared up? How are your processes geared up? How is your performance management geared up to handle this? How's your hiring geared up? Do they all have access to equal opportunities? And let me tell you in the multi-generational workforce, and I love your question, because tomorrow, we're going to have robots working with us. How are you going to interact with them? You have to feel, treat them equally. You have to be inclusive around them. You have to accept even their flaws, help them get better, make peace with the fact that they can do certain things much better than us. So, it is also about all these things in a multi-generational workforce. So, I think creating a psychologically safe space for all these different types of a generational, multi-generational workforce will be the key to thinking about diversity in the long term for organizations. It's already here, and they need to be prepared.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;This brings us to a fascinating question where I would like your thoughts. The other day we were, I read an article by Rishad Premji in the India Express, where he talked about Human Development Growth (HDP). And one of the measures mentioned there was the need to increase the participation of women. Because reports say that, even though there is so much hullabaloo around this topic - around inclusivity, diverse diversity, you know, getting women into the workforce. Still, in the last few years, we've seen considerably decreased participation from the workforce. There are very, very few women in the decision-making posts right now. As I said, there's a lot of work, but what is happening at the ground level is something that I'm thinking about. What are your thoughts on this? Even for our LGBT community, people are not ready to accept the fact. We may say we are pretty modern and think out of the box, but we don't do it at a certain level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;Yeah, no, you're right. Rishad, this right, obviously, also, because it's here for all of us to see, right. The sad thing is what you said, 'the report says that it's getting lesser when it should have been getting better, ' right? We started so many years before; that's exactly how you started this conversation. We have started so many years before. And if you see, there is so much more awareness about this whole thing. Do you agree that there's awareness? Diversity is important. You need to focus on it; all that has also happened. But it has just become about that day. About March 8. The LGBTQ Day. So, this is where I think, organizations, and I would say, this is now not about HR, this is not about the diversity officer who needs to be worried, what should I be doing? How do I increase this?\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is a CEOs mandate. It should be. The CEO should be rallying around this. Let me give you an example. So, if there is an issue with the sales numbers, how does a CEO approach it? The CEO won't be saying, let me create a celebrate sales month? And then because we're celebrating it, sales will improve? Of course not. That's not the way it happens. They get down to where the issue is. What are the ways to fix it? They look, think about it as a business problem. They think about it as tools and what can be done to enable salespeople and change mindsets and talk to customers. And, you know, what are the metrics saying what the evidence around the metrics is, so they approach it entirely like a business problem. And I think that is precisely how this has to be looked at. Only then and, coming straight down from the CEO, because that's when the other business leaders who are primarily male will look at doing this entire thing - making the needle move in a very different way. So, the approach to this cannot be about how we have done it, which is about celebrating it and making a day out of it and then forgetting it. It has to be about hiring an equal number of people; are we giving an equal number of opportunities? What does a performance management system expect out of managers? That's how it needs to be looked at.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo, your question on what's happening at the grassroots level - grassroots level is the same. In fact, grassroots level, if you look at any IT company, 50% of the workforce are equal when they come from the colleges, then after you see this really sharp drop, as people you know, get to the top. Now there are several reasons for that. But what a company is doing to enable that if people have to take off for different reasons. And in this particular case, if it needs to be a woman, how do the policies and processes work to ensure that they can come back faster. And once they come back, how easy it is to bring them back into the mainstream seamlessly. There are a lot of things that need to be done. But the first and foremost thing is it has to become a business item and a business agenda. Just like if your sales were high, you know, your sales numbers were low. I mean, that's almost like the most extreme example I'm taking, but it needs to be looked at like that if we want to see a shift.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So again, I'll be coming back to the question that one, why is it important at the workplace? And how can organizations move from 'some' to a 'from all' concept steadily?\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;So Anannya, I think I've answered some of it in my answer about how can organizations move to it? I think the answer lies, and I genuinely believe it is about the topmost leader because you're watching the topmost leader become a business item, and then the agenda, that's how it needs to be looked at, and it will work. In organizations, especially bias on the ground happens in different ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThere are five types of ways that it happens. So, I think this is what organizations probably need to look at to ensure that it does not occur. It borders on unconscious bias. But I think it's happening as we speak. So other than this, one way of doing itâ€¦the answer is, of course, the CEO making it a business agenda. The other way is to understand what all these biases are. So, for example, typically, for some people in an organization, this could be anywhere, globally, because whether it's race, gender, LGBTQ age, disability, sometimes even social class, this happens to different types of people.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eSo one is â€“\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Prove it Again'\u003c/strong\u003e. Sadly, there are many people in an organization; they just have to prove it again. So you could do something, but you will have to do it again. And again. And again. Unlike we are used to a standard person who would do it, and you'll be like, wow, that's amazing, this person met the sales target. Now think about it, if there was somebody in the example that I gave you, because of our biases was on race or gender or age, you just be like, 'oh, maybe this was one time. Let's see if they can do it again.' You know, so this prove it again, bias is sort of inherent in organizations.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe second is\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'That Tight Rope'\u003c/strong\u003e. What that means is â€” if men, again largely, show that they are authoritative, you're like, wow, what a leader, walking the tight rope. But the same thing if women were to do it? The first thing people would be like, Oh! This person is so bossy? So, that's the thing. You look at it differently. And again, it's the bias. So, these are things that organizations should train people on.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe third one is interesting. It's called the '\u003cstrong\u003eTug of War'\u003c/strong\u003e, which is a tug of war between like if I'm one woman, and up for that one position and there is a seat on the table only for a woman to come into this particular say panel or board. I'm now going to be having this tug of war with other women. And the same thing with race or people of colour, they are doing it with this similar type.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThe fourth one is what we all call the\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Maternal Wall.'\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;This is to do with women who actually come back and mothers who feel they need to prove that they need to do more. So, it's also about them themselves, but also the organization. They should be thinking about making it much easier because women are constantly otherwise about having to prove themselves. Organizations have to do this better for their seamless transition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eNow the fifth one is just\u0026nbsp;\u003cstrong\u003e'Racial Stereotypes'\u003c/strong\u003e. Now we could be in India, but you know, to some extent, we're saying we're from the North, South, East or the Western part of the country. It just comes now; we don't even mean it so, and we sometimes bring that kind of stereotyping as well into into into work. So, there's so much we all need to work on, not only as organizations but also as individuals. That's how I would look at it. It's a combination. If we are all looking at this globalized world, we all have to drop our armour somehow.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnannya:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely right. There are instances, you know, while we were talking about this, I could reflect on. I've seen it, or I've faced it. These biases have been there; of course, they were nonintentional, but they've happened. Oh! You are a mother who's coming back after a seven-year hiatus? My God, how are you going to do it? How will you manage?\u003cstrong\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eAnd then the other way around â€” if you do it and you're succeeding at it, then they're thinking that maybe they're you're neglecting to be a great mother. This is so relatable, and it's not just me alone. There are so many women across the board who go through a day-in-day-out, and as I said, it's not intentional. It is how we've been brought up.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShruthi:\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. And it's a socialist, by the way, this entire thing. What do we take to work is who we are and who are we? We are all that we are when we are not at work. How we grew up, how we are at home, so organizations they'll train you and everything but end of the day you are going back home. There is a whole social aspect to how you live today. So, it's tough; it's not easy. Each of us has to almost open up and allow us to look at things very differently.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"text-align:justify;\"\u003eThis is Part 1 of the series.
