Things might get tough for humans, but these adorable animals are here to tell you to keep yourself motivated (and amused) at work!</p>
<p><strong><em>1.Hang in there<br />
</em></strong>As a Disney Channel show must have quoted in its prime, “<em>Life is like a roller-coaster. It has a slow climb, only to let you drop down and have fun at the end!”</em> That is why you have to tell yourself that whatever is keeping you down at work is only temporary. There will be an end to it and the sun will shine. In short, there is a leprechaun with a pot of gold waiting for you at the end of the rainbow! All you have to do is hang in there and not give up.<br />
<em> <img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7928" src="https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png?resize=225%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png?w=225&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/1.png?w=338&amp;ssl=1 338w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></em></p>
<p><strong><em>2.Take your chances</em></strong><br />
You will miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. A simple mathematical equation to tell you that if zero chances are taken, there is a 10/10 probability of failure. So, if you are feeling down at work, remember that making even the most slightest of efforts will give you a chance at success. No matter how small, a chance is still a chance!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7929" src="https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.png?resize=300%2C267&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="267" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/2.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>3.Remember, you’re always in control</em></strong><br />
One of the things that people tend to do at the workplace is think that their work is the boss of them. But that&#8217;s not true! Work is just human generated tasks to make yourself feel competent and important. YOU ARE IMPORTANT NO MATTER WHAT OTHERS SAY! So have a little faith in yourself and keep telling yourself you have whatever you’re doing in control.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7930" src="https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3.png?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3.png?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/3.png?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>4.Self confidence is key</em></strong><br />
Why are you at the position you’re in? Because you are that damn good. You’re the best at what you do. You’re the best at sitting in that chair and typing away on the keyboard. This is why you haven’t been replaced by some intern from Kathuriabagh University ;). On any given day, you are the very best at the task you’ve been allotted. Feel that way, ALWAYS!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7931" src="https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.png?resize=300%2C240&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="240" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/4.png?w=610&amp;ssl=1 610w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>5.Always take a head-on approach</em></strong><br />
Why wait for things to come to you when you can meet them face-to-face on your own terms? Always stay ahead of your work. This way you’re not dragged down by pending files, documents or phone calls. And maybe, just maybe, if you do go head-on and finish your tasks early, you get to go home early! YES! GO HOME AND LOOK AT MEMES!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-7932" src="https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.png?resize=300%2C300&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.png?w=300&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.png?w=150&amp;ssl=1 150w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.png?w=550&amp;ssl=1 550w, https://i2.wp.com/edgenetworks.in/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5.png?w=610&amp;ssl=1 610w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>
<p><strong><em>6.It’s all up to you</em></strong><br />
At the end of the day, you’re your own person. Your work does not define who you are. But you can define what others view you as. Whether you’re someone who shys away from work or someone who takes charge. You’re a part of a team, wherever you work. If you’re not motivated enough, your team will lack too. So don’t let your team or your own self down. Pick yourself up and make sure you set the right example for your own team.</p>
